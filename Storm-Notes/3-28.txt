So we had the interview yesterday and I think that went wellish for everyone.
But also no notes for that day and I promise I'm going to pay attention to notes for angular today.

imports take modules into a module so that you can see and use the things in them.
Export lets other modules see what you have inside you so they can use it.

Inside modules are components.
Module must declare a whole bunch of things I guess too.

Rootmodules must have bootstrap with all of the things it needs.

Services have a providedin. by the root. basically a singleton. 

module also has providers list.

descriptors are the things that let you know whatw it is. Like selectors and styleIRls. or templateURLs

Template syntax -  {{  }} interpolation TS this.name,
[disabled]="disabled" or in the component  this.disabled.    property binding 
event binding (click)="handleClick(event)" in TS handlClick() {      }
[(ngModel)]="data"   to this.data  two-way binding   
import FormsModule

so he is back to the Pokemon example he is using so I doubt I will be able to follow.

ng g component charcter   - creates a new thing called character


major version number - changed when there is any broken back-wards compatability

minor version number - new features without changing old things.

patch - just bugfixes


same-origin policy means that a server request through a browser must come from the user not another website.
Is by default not allowed. But can be allowed on the server side.



so about that promise....
