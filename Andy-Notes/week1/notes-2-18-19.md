## using .NET
- check version `dotnet --version`
	- find latest version google `.net core sdk` or [site download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- now use `dotnet new console`
	- generate a new .net project from a variety of templates (e.g. console)
	- `dotnet new console -n name-of-project` to create that project
- `dotnet restore` to download all 3rd party dependencies
- `dotnet build` compiles your code
- `dotnet run` runs code (in the DLL)
	- can be more specific if outside folder: `dotnet --project run 01_hello_world`
- can open a vscode window in terminal with `code someFolderName`
- open terminal on VSCode with `CTRL + ~`

## Training 
- code in revature folder 02-c-sharp-basics
- namespaces can be shortened with using to make an alias

	- fields: raw data
	- are inside namespaces
