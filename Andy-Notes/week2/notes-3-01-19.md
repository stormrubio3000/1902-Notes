# Revature 3-01-19 Notes

## [Repository Pattern](https://deviq.com/repository-pattern/)
- provides an abstraction of data
	- adding, removing, updates, and select done through series of straightforward methods
	- no DB headache (connections, commands, cursors, readers)
	- loose coupling
- a method is a *Repository per entity or business Object*
	- should only implement specific methods called in your app
-another is a *generic repository interface*
	- common interface for working with any of your objects
- 	```csharp
		public class Repository<T> : IRepository<T> where T : EntityBase
		{
		    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;
		    public Repository(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
		    {
		        _dbContext = dbContext;
		    }
		    public virtual T GetById(int id)
		    {
		        return _dbContext.Set<T>().Find(id);
		    }
		    public virtual IEnumerable<T> List()
		    {
		        return _dbContext.Set<T>().AsEnumerable();
		    }
		    public virtual IEnumerable<T> List(System.Linq.Expressions.Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate)
		    {
		        return _dbContext.Set<T>()
		               .Where(predicate)
		               .AsEnumerable();
		    }
		    public void Insert(T entity)
		    {
		        _dbContext.Set<T>().Add(entity);
		        _dbContext.SaveChanges();
		    }
		    public void Update(T entity)
		    {
		        _dbContext.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Modified;
		        _dbContext.SaveChanges();
		    }
		    public void Delete(T entity)
		    {
		        _dbContext.Set<T>().Remove(entity);
		        _dbContext.SaveChanges();
		    }
		}
	```

## [DB Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/logging)
- something

## [Loading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data)
- **Eager loading** means that the related data is loaded from the database as part of the initial query.
	- You can use the `Include` method to specify related data to be included in query results
		- join of two separate tables
		- e.g. a <- main -> b
	- You can chain multiple calls to `ThenInclude` to continue including further levels of related data.
		- join of two levels deep
		- e.g. main -> a -> b
- **Lazy loading** means that the related data is transparently loaded from the database when the navigation property is accessed.
	- gets expoentially worse as you go deeper, AVOID in real apps

## EF Notes
- There's a redundant data in what EF returns, especially when
	- notes incomplete

## OTHERS
- transactions can have savepoints
	- `SAVE TRANSACTION <savepoint-name>`
	- `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION <savepoint-name>`
		- bad things happen, we go back to our save point
- views can be created with option SCHEMABINDING
	- used to show the old shape of the DB
	- means table underneath the view cannot be changed in a way that would break the view
- indexes, clustered and non clustered
	- default on primary key and unique
	- often good idea to add on FK
	- `CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_name on Movie.Movie(GenreID)`
	- **Clustered index**
		- directly related to the physical layout of the table
		- by default PK adds clustered index
	- **Nonclustered Index** (like an encyclopedia)
		- can have many by default, on UNIQUE
		- usually beneficial to create non clustered index on each FK
	- Basically a BST, and fast if in sorted order
	- indexing make some commands slower
		- if you have lots of index it decreases WRITE performance
			- READ vs WRITE tradeoff
	- **SQL Server Profiler** (Azure has its own version as well)
		- gives some form of inspection that would give recommendations on how to improve query
- Scan: sql server iterates through many vals looking for right one
- Seek: sql server is able to look up what it needs much faster (binary search uses an index)
	- think about when indexes can be used
	- if query has WHERE index(col = val) we can use it
	- if it has WHERE SOME_FUNCTION(indexedCol) 
- in some cases a join based query can be faster than a subquery based query
	- when subquery is doing some EXISTS check
		- based on the values from outer query we should replace with INNER JOIN
	- 	```sql
		SELECT *
		FROM Customer as c
		WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Invoice AS i,
			WHERE i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId)
		```
- [SMALL EXERCISE WITH Azure Studios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/tutorial-qds-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017#view-insight-details-for-more-information)
	- install azure data studio, see if you prefer it
- Project Architectures
	- Layered Architecture: 
		- some kind of ui layer where we do ui stuffs
			- new DBContext
			- `IRepo r = new Repo()`
		- then business logic layer
		- data access layer
		- then to some SQL DB
		- `[UI](Main) -> [BL] (->someRepo->mapping) -> [DA], and [UI] -> [DA]` 
			- breaks our dependency inversion principle
		- another is Domain Driven Design
			- domain is what we're building on our library
			- things orbit around instead of depending 
			- `[UI](Main) -> [DA] (->someRepo->mapping) -> [BL]`
			- `[UI] -> [BL] -> someIrepo`
- Unit test
	- also an EF InMemory be a DB that lives in mem
	- can also SQLite inMemory
	- strategy for testing:
		- at least one DB context for each 
		- arrange -> new dbContext
		- act -> new dbContext
		- assert -> new dbContext
- repository's job is provide CRUD on library objects 
	- internally implemented by converting to/from EF objects

## Project 0 advice
- if encounter NULL somewhere, you probably missed an Include somewhere

### DATABASE Plan
- Location:
	- StoreId (INT) PK
	- Store Name (NVARCHAR)

- Inventory (can have many items)
	- itemRemaining (INT)
	- StoreId (INT) (FK to location)
	- itemId (Fk -> ItemProducts.itemId )

- ItemProducts
	- ItemID (INT PK)
	- ItemName (NVARCHAR)
	- ItemPrice (MONEY)
	- NumBought (INT)
- Order
	- OrderId (INT) (Fk to Customers)
	- StoreId (INT) (FK to Location)
	- Date Bought (DATETIME2)
	- Sum (INT)
- OrderList
	- OrderId (FK to ORDER)
	- ItemId (FK to ItemProducts)
- Customer
	- CustomerId (INT) PK
	- FirstName (NVARCHAR)
	- LastName (NVARCHAR)
	- defaultStoreId (INT) (FK -> Location)
