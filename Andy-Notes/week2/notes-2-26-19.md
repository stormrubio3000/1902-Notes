# SQL

## Installation stuffs
- google: Visual Studios Dev Essentials
	- sign in with some microsoft account (Free trial, beware after 1 year)
- some extra learning: [c#](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/programming-in-c-jump-start-14254?l=j0iuozSfB_6900115888)
- We'll use MS Azure
- [SQL server management studios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)

## Azure create SQL Databases
- create resource group
- should change firewall to allow new IP address
	- go resource then show firewall settings or firewalls and virtual networks
		- office-autologin: 129.107.80.117
		- or start: 129.107.80.0,  end: 129.107.80.255
- on SSMS:
	- server name is: dbName.database.windows.net
	- once in, interact with `New Query`
	- change on top left from master to whatever DB you are working with
	- execute with `f5`

## relational database
- data organized into separate 
	-tables with
		- rows
		- columns
- database management system (DBMS)
	- creating and managing databases
- relational DBMS (RDBMS)
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
	- SQL Server (TSQL) or Transact SQL
		- it's a language to interact with RDBMS
	- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle SQL
- **Functional Dependency**: 
	- a relationship between one set of col and another set
	- for two sets of columns X and Y ...
		- X depends on Y if, for each possible set of y values, there is exactly one possible set of x values
		- (Y -> X): values of X determined by Y
		- if two rows had the same Y, you'd know the values of X must be the same
		- X is a fact about Y
		- From Table 1, Phone <-> Supplier, although can go both ways
		- assuming if there's one supplier per product: Product -> Supplier
		- Product -> color, product -> phone
	- often the "sets" are size 1
- **candidate key** (of a table)
	- something for a particular table
	- minimal set of col that every other col depends on 
		- cannot remove anything more from the set without breaking
	- Product is a candidate key from Table 1
	- The values of any candidate key can uniquely identify that row
- **Primary key** (of a table)
	- one of the candidate keys that we choose to actually identify the row
	- could be more than one col at a time
	- (any key with more than one col in it is called a *composite key*)
- **Foreign Key(FK)**
	- col that has copies of a table's primary keys to est. a relationship between the rows of the two tables.  
	- serves as a pointer from one row to another row
- **Non-atomic values** (atomic means indivisible)
	- problem: hard to read values, have to search through strings
	- in Table 1 for colors the Black, Red
- **update anomaly**
	- With redundant data, we might not update all copies 
	- e.g. what if Microsoft changed their phone number, has to change for all of them
- **deletion anomaly**
	- if we delete some data, we sometimes lost other data depending how it is laid out
		- if we delete row with Amazon, and it's the only data that exists with it, we lose their phone number
- **insertion anomaly**
	- it becomes impossible to insert some data without some associated data
- **Normalization** 
	- process of restructuring how our data is set up
	- [1NF  [2NF  [3NF] ] ] 
		- when we get to 3NF, we'll say it's fully normalized, PHD can have fun with anything after
		- *1NF*: first normal form, remade into TABLE 2
			1. no duplicate rows (enforce with a PK)
			2. atomic values 
			3. no repeating groups of col (e.g. Color1, Color2, Color3...)
		- *2NF*: second normal form
			1. meet conditions of 1NF
			2. no non-CK col may depend on PART of any composite CK
				- no partial dependency
		- *3NF*
			1. 2NF
			2. no non-CK col may depend on any other non-CK col
				- no transitive dependencies
	- now our candidate key is ID
- Table 2 is a *N-to-1* relationship between color and product/ID
- **referential integrity**:
	- every foreign key value correspond to an existing row in the other table
- "CK columns" / "non-CK columns" is how you split up your table
- Table 4: Candidate keys: CityID, City, State
	- to satisfy 2NF we will make a state table with regions as a col
- Solution to have 3NF is to keep splitting up tables so that no column would depend on another
- normal forms mnemonics
	- non-CK col should depend on "the keys, the whole keys, and nothing but the keys"
- Normalization
	- pros
		- less redundancy
			- less errors
		- easier to evolve data model
		- easier to read and write with consistency 
	- cons
		- can make some queries slower

### Tables
**Table 1**	

| ID | Product    | color       | supplier  | Phone    |
|----|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | widget     | red         | Microsoft | 555-1234 |
| 2  | Thingybob  | black, red  | Amazon    | 555-4321 |
| 3  | knicknacks | black, blue | Microsoft | 555-1234 |

**Table 2**

| ID | Product    | color | supplier  | Phone    |
|----|------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | widget     | red   | Microsoft | 555-1234 |
| 2  | Thingybob  | black | Amazon    | 555-4321 |
| 3  | knicknacks | black | Microsoft | 555-1234 |
| 4  | Thingybob  | red   | Amazon    | 555-4321 |
| 5  | knicknacks | blue  | Microsoft | 555-1234 |

**Table 3**

| ID | Color |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Red   |
| 2  | Black |
| 3  | Black |
| 2  | Red   |
| 3  | Blue  |

ID is the foreign key between these two tables

| ID | Product    | supplier  | Phone    |
|----|------------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | widget     | Microsoft | 555-1234 |
| 2  | Thingybob  | Amazon    | 555-4321 |
| 3  | knicknacks | Microsoft | 555-1234 |
| 2  | Thingybob  | Amazon    | 555-4321 |
| 3  | knicknacks | Microsoft | 555-1234 |

**Table 4**

| CityId | City | State | SalesTotal |
|--------|------|-------|------------|
|        |      |       |            |

FK to State

| State | Region |
|-------|--------|
|       |        |

**Table 5**

| ID | Product    | supplier  |
|----|------------|-----------|
| 1  | widget     | Microsoft |
| 2  | Thingybob  | Amazon    |
| 3  | knicknacks | Microsoft |
| 2  | Thingybob  | Amazon    |
| 3  | knicknacks | Microsoft |

FK is supplier in this case

| supplier  | Phone    |
|-----------|----------|
| Microsoft | 555-1234 |
| Amazon    | 555-4321 |

ID is FK for color

| ID | Color |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Red   |
| 2  | Black |
| 3  | Black |
| 2  | Red   |
| 3  | Blue  |
