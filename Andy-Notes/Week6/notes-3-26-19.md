## Angular
- recommended to follow the [Heroes Tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial)
- https://angular.io/guide/http
- https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/12/21/build-basic-web-app-with-mvc-angular
- **Module**: container/namespace for components/directives, types etc...
	- it is just an empty class that we put a decorator on it
		- class + ng-module decorator
		- vs sees the class, Angular looks at the decorator
	- it can import such from other modules 
	- must export its own for others to see
- `[app]root module (root component)`
