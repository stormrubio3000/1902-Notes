Not doing a lot of page refreshes. Not getting a whole new html page.

Javascript is just going to do a lot of dynamic changes of the DOM.

Thats what angular is going to target.

Is going to be very concerned with how we have strongly typed data. 
and the DOM where reactive and reflective of the data. 
DOM = document object model.

Angular uses TS to achieve single page applications. 

TS has interfaces and classes and some are going to be special and have decorators to upgrade them.

Angular special decorators @Component, @NgModule, @Injectable, @Directive

job of an angular component is to manage a view. we can nest them. 
references a template HTMl + directives + binding


modules provide namespace and compilation context for components, other directives, pipes, services 

A component must be declared in a module. knows about the Ng stuff
Must have at least one module called root module(AppModule)

TS module is a .ts file with inports and/or exports at the the top. just keeps things out of the global scope.

Injectable turns something into a service. view-independent logic that supports D.I.

directives are anything that is not valid html that we put in the html file.Ngstyle,Ngif,NgFor

app route directive - basically the selector?
