# notes 4/3/19
- remember repo found in: https://github.com/revaturexyz

## Project 3 stuffs
- everyone has to setup certificates per laptop per repo
- DocFX reads src code and generates some html stuffs describing the file
	- `docfx --serve`
- User story fix DocFx maybe?
- Used to use Vagrant now using Docker toolbox for updating the Readme
- **real readme we want is the dockerup.windev.yml-README.md**
	- designed to run in docker stack 
	- ran with dockerup.yml and dockerup.windev.yml
	- example of one of them: https://github.com/revaturexyz/servicehub-user/blob/broker/dockerup.windev.yml-README.txt
	- guid: global unique identifier
	- follow along the instruction under Full explanation of testing your local code with Docker:
		- to test locally
- `docker stack ps servicehub-user-stack` 
	- tells you about something about the current running containers
	- tells us the health of the docker stack
	- not need to install docker swarm when you first try to use
- `docker stack ls` list out our containers 
- remove stack with: `docker stack rm housing-selection-stack`

### Pivotal
- pivotal id
	- branch name: 12651162-userstory
	- commit meassage contains: [#12651162]
	- we should be doing our tasks within 'task' branch 12651162-whatever
		- defined by team lead (e.g. branch name: whatever)
		- use pull request review to accept or reject with comments
			- review by team lead
- pull request to the broker branch
	- one user story code reviewer will be one of the Matts
	- one of the other team lead should review
	- finally trainer should review

### setting up docker containers
- start with guid in powershell
- then git bash for steps 2 and 3
- now open docker CLI and do those steps
- we made **servicehub-user**
	- fe9738cc-a452-4c98-8e84-ee80015ac412
- run: `docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.99.100` as an example
- after you get everything working, you enter in something like
	- `http://192.168.99.100:9050/api/users`
- now making **servicehub-room**
	- 0cd1347d-80f1-444c-9fe3-51bd4963f736
- testing:
	- docker stack ps --no-trunc servicehub-user-stack
- now making **housing-forecast** api
	- 3af2c684-edfa-45f1-b2dd-425f16ef3b98
- now making **servicehub-batch**
	- 77f4b157-35b7-4357-8b89-df882a4bf30f

### running interface-web-forecast
- to do so everytime we make changes to this library we must run:
	- `npm run build-lib` or `ng build @revaturexyz/forecast`

### Goals
- queues team would like to have Reviews to work 
- hopefully have at least one person with car in the apartment groups
- Possible task
	- rename in Seeder.cs
		- var existed should be called notExisted
		- then the if(existed) should be
			- `if(!notExisted)`
- conrad will make more tonight

## Why use Azure AD
- benefits single log ing
- use because there and the other services that is provided
- also they would have done it right for the auth, devs just need to implement it correctly
	- no need to build by scratch 
- then blah blah from conrad
