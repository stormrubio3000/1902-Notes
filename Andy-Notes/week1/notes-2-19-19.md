- GIT: version control system, open sourced
	- status
	- add
	- commit
	- push
	- pull
	- diff
	- log
	- clone
	- HEAD: current commit
		- `^` is the parent of something
- bash
	- ls
	- mkdir
	- cd
	- rm
		- `-r` for recursive to remove everything in the folder
		- `-f` is force to actually go with it; careful with `rm -rf *`

## GIT
- version control system (VCS)
	- aka source control managerment (SCM) tool
- distributed VCS (e.g. GIT)
	- everybody is the whole repo, everyone has a copy of the repo, backup, scalable
- others:
	- SVN (subversion)
	- hg (mercurial)
	- TFS (team foundation server)
- |0. stash|1. working directory/tree|2. index(staging area)|3. local repo|4. remote repo "origin" (Github)|
	- when you clone you get 1,2,3
	- 0 stack of temp. changes
	- 1 current state of files as fas as non-git aware programs can see
	- 2 temporary place to prepare for a commit
	- 3 permanent record history in commits
	- 4 someone's else history of commits
	- (local 	-> remote) by pushing and 
	- (remote 	-> anything downstream) with pull
	- working 	-> index with add
	- working 	<- index with reset
	- working 	<-> index with diff
	- index 	-> local with commit
	- index 	<-> local diff --cached

## Extended Modifiers
- class
	- static: O
		- static cannot be instantiated into object
			- meant to be namespace for members, just a container for methods
		- all classes can have static members
			- static classes can only have static members
	- virtual: X
	- override: X
	- new: X
	- const: X
	- readonly: x
	- abstract: O
		- abstract class has abstract methods
	- sealed: O
		- inheritance is prohbited (in java is `final`), can't make subclasses
	- partial: O
		- define in more than one file at a time
		- have a main class not modified and another set to edit from
- member
	- static: O
		- not tied to specific instance or obj, cannot access any non static data
	- virtual: O
		- elligible to get overwritten
	- override: O
	- new: O
	- const: O
		- const means can't be changed after you initialize
	- readonly: O
		- similar to const, but more flexible can give value in constructor of class, once object made can't edit
	- abstract: O
		- not all members needs to be abstract
	- sealed: X
	- partial: X
- can have access modifiers on get and set
	- `int x {public get; private set}`

## Access modifiers
- useful link [stack overflow access modifier](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22958035/9587494)
- private: just me
- private protected: uhh intersection of assembly and derived
- public: everything
- internal: assembly
- protected: derived class
- protected internal: everything allowed by internal and protected

## Exception Handling:
- should place more specific catch exceptions on top to more general ones further down
- `ArgumentNullException`: if null is passed as an argument
- `ArgumentException`: when given a bad argument
- using `try` and `catch`
	- where you try to catch error and give some form of feedback or fallback value
	- try is when you try to run some method and see if it works, if not you go catch the error
	- `catch(Exception e)` is bad and lazy, be more specific! 
		- This would catch any exceptions
		- only if you re-throw exception, it's okay; using `throw;`
		- also `catch`
- throw vs throw e
	- throw by itself leaves the stack trace of the exception unchanged
	- using throw e overwrites its stack trace with the current line
- implementations of this differ and sometimes the stack
- finally: contains code that runs after try and catch ends
	- whether or not there was an exception handled or not
	- this is where you release resources that should be released regardless of error or success
