# SQL

## Installation stuffs
- google: Visual Studios Dev Essentials
	- sign in with some microsoft account (Free trial, beware after 1 year)
- some extra learning: [c#](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/programming-in-c-jump-start-14254?l=j0iuozSfB_6900115888)
- We'll use MS Azure
- [SQL server management studios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)

## Azure create SQL Databases
- create resource group
- should change firewall to allow new IP address
	- go resource then show firewall settings or firewalls and virtual networks
		- office-autologin: 129.107.80.117
		- or start: 129.107.80.0,  end: 129.107.80.255
- on SSMS:
	- server name is: dbName.database.windows.net
	- once in, interact with `New Query`
	- change on top left from master to whatever DB you are working with
	- execute with `f5`

## relational database
- data organized into separate 
	-tables with
		- rows
		- columns
- database management system (DBMS)
	- creating and managing databases
- relational DBMS (RDBMS)
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
	- SQL Server (TSQL) or Transact SQL
		- it's a language to interact with RDBMS
	- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle SQL
- **Functional Dependency**: 
	- a relationship between one set of col and another set
	- for two sets of columns X and Y ...
		- X depends on Y if, for each possible set of y values, there is exactly one possible set of x values
		- (Y -> X): values of X determined by Y
		- if two rows had the same Y, you'd know the values of X must be the same
		- X is a fact about Y
		- From Table 1, Phone <-> Supplier, although can go both ways
		- assuming if there's one supplier per product: Product -> Supplier
		- Product -> color, product -> phone
	- often the "sets" are size 1
- **candidate key** (of a table)
	- something for a particular table
	- minimal set of col that every other col depends on 
		- cannot remove anything more from the set without breaking
	- Product is a candidate key from Table 1
	- The values of any candidate key can uniquely identify that row
- **Primary key** (of a table)
	- one of the candidate keys that we choose to actually identify the row
	- could be more than one col at a time
	- (any key with more than one col in it is called a *composite key*)
- **Foreign Key(FK)**
	- col that has copies of a table's primary keys to est. a relationship between the rows of the two tables.  
	- serves as a pointer from one row to another row
- **Non-atomic values** (atomic means indivisible)
	- problem: hard to read values, have to search through strings
	- in Table 1 for colors the Black, Red
- **update anomaly**
	- With redundant data, we might not update all copies 
	- e.g. what if Microsoft changed their phone number, has to change for all of them
- **deletion anomaly**
	- if we delete some data, we sometimes lost other data depending how it is laid out
		- if we delete row with Amazon, and it's the only data that exists with it, we lose their phone number
- **insertion anomaly**
	- it becomes impossible to insert some data without some associated data
- **Normalization** 
	- process of restructuring how our data is set up
	- [1NF  [2NF  [3NF] ] ] 
		- when we get to 3NF, we'll say it's fully normalized, PHD can have fun with anything after
		- *1NF*: first normal form, remade into TABLE 2
			1. no duplicate rows (enforce with a PK)
			2. atomic values 
			3. no repeating groups of col (e.g. Color1, Color2, Color3...)
		- *2NF*: second normal form
			1. meet conditions of 1NF
			2. no non-CK col may depend on PART of any composite CK
				- no partial dependency
		- *3NF*
			1. 2NF
			2. no non-CK col may depend on any other non-CK col
				- no transitive dependencies
	- now our candidate key is ID
- Table 2 is a *N-to-1* relationship between color and product/ID
- **referential integrity**:
	- every foreign key value correspond to an existing row in the other table
- "CK columns" / "non-CK columns" is how you split up your table
- Table 4: Candidate keys: CityID, City, State
	- to satisfy 2NF we will make a state table with regions as a col
- Solution to have 3NF is to keep splitting up tables so that no column would depend on another
- normal forms mnemonics
	- non-CK col should depend on "the keys, the whole keys, and nothing but the keys"
- Normalization
	- pros
		- less redundancy
			- less errors
		- easier to evolve data model
		- easier to read and write with consistency 
	- cons
		- can make some queries slower

## SQL Part 1
```sql
SELECT 'Hello world!';

SELECT * From SalesLT.Customer;

-- is a comment! yay

-- in a SQL server... you have many DBs
-- within each DB we have many "schemas"
-- a schema is a namespace/scope for DB objs

-- in AdventureWorksLT DB, we have schema SalesLT
-- inside schemas, we have many DB objects including tables

--this would switch db from master
-- but azure sql db doesn't support yet
USE AdventureWorksLT;
-- have to use dropdown instead

-- semicolons are not necessary
-- whitespace doesn't matter
-- case also doesn't matter, case inssensitve
SelecT         *
FROM

SalesLt.Customer

-- SQL's string comparison by default is also case-insensitive
-- depnds on the "collation" i.e. the 
-- settings for datetime format, number format


-- The SELECT statement/command ...
-- doesn't even need to access the DB
SELECT 1;
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- we get all col and all rows from a table with SELECT *
-- SELECT *, and FROM
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Customer

-- we can select which cols we want by replacing the *
SELECT Title, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customer;

-- we can do "aliases"
SELECT FirstName AS [First Name], LastName AS "Last Name"
FROM SalesLT.Customer;

-- we can computer new values from the col values
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS [Full Name]
FROM SalesLT.Customer;

-- we can process the returned rows with DISTINCT
-- any rows of the result set that have all the same col values
-- will be de-duplicated

-- get all first names that customers have
SELECT DISTINCT FirstName
FROM SalesLT.Customer;

-- we can filter rows on conditions as well
-- with WHERE clause
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE FirstName = 'Alice'

SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE FirstName = 'Alice' AND LastName != 'Steiner';
-- so we have boolean operators AND and OR and NOT
-- not queals != (traditional SQL is <>)

-- We have ordered comparison of numbers, dates, time, and strings
-- strings are ordered by "dictionary order" "lexicographic order"
-- but this is affected by collation
-- with operators < <= > >=

-- all customers whose first name starts with C
SELECT * 
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE FirstName >= 'c' AND FirstName < 'd';
-- everything that starts with c and has more letters too 
-- sorts after 'c'

-- we can sort the results (they are in undefined order by default)
-- ORDER BY clause accomplishes this
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE FirstName >= 'c' AND FirstName < 'd'
ORDER BY FirstName, LastName DESC; 
-- ordering is "ascending" (ASC) by default, but can be descending(DESC)

-- we can do regex-lite pattern matching on strings with LIKE operator;
-- all customers with first name starting with c, then a vowel
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'C[aeoiu]%'
-- [abc] for one character , either a, b, or c
-- % for any num of any characters
-- _ for one of any character
```

## SQL part 2
```sql
-- in SSMS, like in VS, we have CTRL+K,C for comment, CTRL+K,U uncomment

-- data types
--   numerics
--      - TINYINT	(1 byte) (aka byte/char)
--      - SMALLINT	(2 bytes) (aka short)
--		- INT		(4 bytes) (use this one when we have no special need)
--		- BIGINT	(8 bytes) (aka long)
--	 floating point
--		- FLOAT
--		- REAL
--		- DECIMAL/NUMERIC(n,p) (highest-precision + custom precision -- we use this one)
--			DECIMAL(4, 3) means, 4 digits with 3 of them after the decimal point.
--	 currency
--		- MONEY ($ in american collation)
--	 string
--		- CHAR/CHARACTER(n)
--			fixed length string with size N
--				uses one byte character encoding specific by the collation
--		- VARCHAR/CHARACTER VARYING(n)
--			variable length string up to size N
--				when we say 'abc', this is a VARCHAR
--			we can set N to MAX (VARCHAR(MAx)) and that will allow maximum size
--		- NCHAR(n)
--			unicode CHAR (the N stands for 'national')
--		- NVARCHAR(n)
--			unicode VARCHAR, this is the one we use all the time for string stuff
--			we use this to store many international alphabets without depending on collation
--				when we say N'abc', this is an NVARCHAR
--			(can also use MAX here)
--	 date/time
--		- DATE for dates
--		- TIME for times
--		- DATETIME for timestamps, for times of a certain day
--			low precision and limited range! don't use
--		- DATETIME2 for high-precision, wide-range timestamps
--			N controls precision 
--		- DATETIMEOFFSET for intervals of time
--		- we can use EXTRACT to get e.g. YEAR from out of a DATETIME2.
--			there's also implicit conversion from strings, so I can compare
--			dates with '2019'


-- SELECT statement advanced usage
-- GROUP BY clause
-- by itself, it doesn't do a lot, but it becomes useful with aggregate functions
--	aggregate f(n) are functions that take in many values and return one value
--		COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX

-- all first name of customers, and the number of duplicates of them
SELECT FirstName, COUNT(FirstName) AS Count
FROM SalesLT.Customer
GROUP BY FirstName
ORDER BY COUNT(FirstName) DESC;

-- GROUP By accepts a list of col, and for all rows which share the same
-- values of all thos col are combined into one row in the result set
-- COUNT(*) does same thing as below
SELECT FirstName, COUNT(FirstName) AS Count, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customer
GROUP BY FirstName, LastName
ORDER BY COUNT(FirstName) DESC;
-- if we have a GROUP BY, we can't use any col in the select list
-- unless we say how to combine it together
-- EITHER you make it the basis for combining rows (put it in the GROUP BY)
-- OR, you run some aggregate functions which says how to turn the many values
--	into one value

-- how can I show all first names having no duplicates?
SELECT FirstName
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE COUNT(FirstName) = 1
GROUP BY FirstName; -- doesn't work
-- first rows from the table are filtered with WHERE
-- then we run any aggregations with GROUP BY
-- if we want to run conditions based on the aggregate rows, we need the HAVING clause
SELECT FirstName AS fn
FROM SalesLT.Customer
WHERE Lastname < 'n' -- we dont have to return every col we use
GROUP BY FirstName
HAVING COUNT(FirstName) = 1
ORDER BY fn;

-- logical order of execution of a SELECT statement
-- essentially it "runs" in the order you write it, except, the SELECT clause is last
-- 1. FROM
-- 2. WHERE
-- 3. GROUP BY
-- 4. HAVING
-- 5. SELECT
-- 6. ORDER BY
