Housing application - going to be inheriting code. 7ish months since code last touched.

Microservices architexture

Micro service has its own database. Is going to expose API. Going to have a whole bunch of them.
They will talk to each other to build the answer for any request coming from above.
Will be put together and delopyed through docker and containers. 
Container Orchestration - Most common one is Kubernetes.
We are going to be using Docker Swarm which is on its way out.
Docker Swarm - docker-compose.yml
