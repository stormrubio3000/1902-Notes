# Notes 2/20/19
- **REMINDER** grab sublime settings from mac
- also disable space to auto complete in VSCode
- add a ruler for VSCode
- learn shortcuts and possibly add my own
- go over unit testing fact later
- Cognizant is our client

## More Github
- origin master: remote tracking branch that tracks remote repo
- master is your local branch
	- master is the one we can modify all that we want
- fast forward merge: branch directly ahead and you run with `git merge someFeature` and merge your untracked changes
- think of branches like nodes with reference pointers, when you push you add a node at the end
- `git pull` is shortcut for git fetch and merge
	- fetch updates the remote tracking branches
	- merge: (with no args) merges the right r.t.b into the current branch
- merge commit brings all changes from different commits into one
	- you usually have to deal with merge conflicts at this point
- commit often, pull often, push often
- need know about base and this in terms of constructors

## Collection Notes
- **base()** means if someone calls the zero param constructor
	- done by default
- fields or props default values are copied to every constructor
- by default T can be any type
- when you make a new class inheriting from another, all fields, methods, and props are inherited
	- constructors are not inherited
- every non abstract class has at least one constructor
- arrays: can make fixed length list of things
	- `int[] ints1 = new int[5]`
	- `int[] ints2 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 50 };`
	- can go through array wth for loop or foreach
		- foreach can't change items in the array 
		- can have arrays of any type
		- `int[][] twoDArry = new int[9][];`
		- jagged array, each row could have diff len if we want
	- rarely use arrays except for performance
- Lists are more common and wide range of helpful functions
	- use .Add or init syntax for initial contents
	- 	```csharp
		var list = new ArrayList { 5, 8, 1 };
        list.AddRange(new int[] { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 });
        list.Remove(8);
		```
	- can index into the list as if array
	- generics replaced ArrayLists since everything that got placed into Arraylists were converted into objects
- **Generics**
	- this list doesn't upcast everything to object, only allow whatever is specified
	- `var genericList = new List<int> { 1,2,3};`
- **Sets**: has no concept of duplicates, it's either in or not
	- no concept of order
	- `var set = new HashSet<string>();`
	- checking membership in the set is fast
	- 	```cs
		var list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 };
        var withoutDupes = new List<int>(new HashSet<int>(list));
		```
- a point of a dictionary is to store a key value relationship
	- 	```csharp
			var dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();
            // store k,v of things between things
            dictionary["classroom"] = "room where classes are held";
            // also have initializer syntax for dictionaries
            var grades = new Dictionary<string, double>();
            grades["Nick"] = 80;
		```
	- helpful members: Keys, Values, ContainsKey, ContainsValue, TryGetValue
	- dictionay obj lets you use any type you want to index into it and any type to use for value stored for that key

## Testing:
- // usually write one test class to write one of our real classes
- manual testing... run the code in IDEs and plug in diff inputs and make sure we get expected output
- automated testing: write instructions for a test and the expected results, then we rerun lots of tests auto
	- this helps us find and solve bugs quicker for subsequent development
    - helps us design well in the first place
    - testable code is better designed code
- unit testing is a particular kind of automated testing
	- resolve to test the smallest pieces we can at a time
	- alternative is integration testing
- `[Fact]` if our 1st example of a c# attrib
- 3 general steps to unit test
	1. arrange
	2. act
	3. assert
- Subject under test(SUT): call obj that's being tested
- use Assert.True or false variable
- assertion succeeds if the right exception was thrown
	- fails if not thrown
- second type of xunit test is `[Theory]`
	- accept set of params to test against the code

## C# stuffs String/ Data type
- StringEquality:
	- value types vars store their values directly
	- reference type variables store a reference to their value
	- in  c# many of our basic types are value types
		- int, double, bool, float, long
	- 	```csharp
			int n1 = 5;
            int n2 = n1; // int is value type so n2 gets a copy of n1
            var dummy1 = new Dummy();
            var dummy2 = dummy1;
            dummy1.Data = 10;
            if(dummy2.Data == 10)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("reference type");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Value type");
            }
            // Dummy is a ref type, so dummy2 is a copy of the ref
            // e.g. a new ref to the same object
            // obj made from classes are ref types, always
            // obj made from structs are value types
            // all the built in val types are structs in c#
            var vDummy1 = new ValueDummy();
            var vDummy2 = vDummy1;
            vDummy2.Data = 10;
            if (vDummy2.Data == 10)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("reference type");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Value type");
            }
		```
- structs: 
	- copied entirely everytime we pass it to a new method or assign to a new var
		- value types are deleted from mem as it goes out of scope
	- ref type we get a new copy of a ref,
		- but to same underlying obj
		- ref types needs to be garbage collected since we don't know when last var is out of scope
		- obj made in classes are always ref types
		- obj made from structs are always value types
		- all the built in value types are structs in c#
		- unmanaged: manually write code to delete ref from mem
		- managed code: there is a garbage that runs periodically to search for obj unreachable for any running part of the code
			- tradeoff: comp works hard, we solve problems
- Normally `==` compares value types by value and ref by ref
	- `Console.WriteLine(new Dummy() == new Dummy());`
	- false... for val types like structs, they dont have to be same obj, just same val
	- exception for string sbecause awkward to do string.Equals() for comparing strings
	- in c# all value tupes derive ultimately from obj so we can always upcast them to obj vars
	- implicit upcasting aka boxing
		- `object o2 = i1;`
	- unboxing: the reverse with downcasting
		- `int i2 = (int)o2; // extract that valu from inside the obj wrapper`
