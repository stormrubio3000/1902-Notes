Practiced QC for the first half of the day


Started with joins

CROSS, RIGHT LEFT, INNER, OUTER

The most common was inner join which is just join as default and is used for matching forigen keys to primary keys.

Then moved on to sub queries can use them in place of joins. They can do most of the same things basically just a different syntax.

Different operators are in and not in which are for multiple results.

the <,>,=,!= are all going to give us back single results. 

any and some are the same thing.

Set Operators - 

Unions - which is basically OR.

Intersects - which is AND

Except - A and Not B. only the first column mentioned that isn't in B.

DML commands - 
	Select - 
 	insert - 
 	Update - 
	Delete - 
 	Truncate -

Started DDL ( Data Definetion Lang)

Create, Alter, Drop

can be used on higher database objects

Constriants - 
	Not Null - 
	Primary Key - is primary identifier
	Identity - set next to primary key to auto inc. cannot be changed explictly.
	Forgien key - as a constraint points to another table.
	default - sets default
	check - sets a operatotion that must be satisfied.
	unique - can be used in a composite key for a unique row of those columns

Then just examples in the sql notes github
	
This sets up a constraint for the unique composite key. Can be used to make a primary key as well.	
constraint U_Movie_Title_Date unique (Title, ReleasaeDate)
	




Truncate just empties a table. Drop will remove the table as an object.
