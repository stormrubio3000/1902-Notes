## Summary [MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
- MVC: models, views, controller
	- req routed to Controller which works with Model to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries
	- controller chooses which view to display to the user
		- provides with any Model data needed
	- ![MVC image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview/_static/mvc.png?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
	- **Model** represents state of app and any business logic performed by it
		- business logic encapsulated in model and implementation logic
		- strongly typed views use ViewModel types to contain data to display on view
			- controller creates and populates these
	- **View** represents content through the user interface
		- uses *Razor view engine* to embed .NET code in HTML startup
			- should be few to no logic, if needed then use View Component, ViewModel, or template
	- **Controller** are components used to handle user interaction, work with model, and select view to render
		- controller handles and responds to user input and interacction
		- controller is initial entry point
		- select which model types work with
			- which views to render
- What is ASP.NET Core MVC
	- lightweight, open source, testable presentation framework optimized to use with ASP.NET Core
	- provides pattern based way to build dynamic websites enabling clean separation of concerns
	- **routing** powerful URL mapping component lets you build apps that have comprehensible and searchable URLs
		- define app URL naming patterns work well with *search engine optimization (SEO)* and link generation
		- **convention-based routing** globally define URL formats that your app accepts
			- also formats map to specific action method on given controller
			- `routes.MapRoute(name: "Default", template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");`
		- **attribute routing** specify routing info by decorating controller and captions with attributes that define app routes
			- route def are placed next to controller and action associated
			- 	```csharp
				[Route("api/[controller]")]
				public class ProductsController : Controller
				{
				  [HttpGet("{id}")]
				  public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
				  {
				    ...
				  }
				}
				```
	- **model binding**:
		- converts client request data (form values, route data, query string parameters, HTTP headers) into objects that the controller can handle
		- `public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model, string returnUrl = null) { ... }`
	- **model validation**
		- decorating your model object with data annotation validation attributes
		- checked on the client side before values are posted to the server, as well as on the server before the controller action is called.
		- 	```csharp
			// model
			using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
			public class LoginViewModel
			{
			    [Required]
			    [EmailAddress]
			    public string Email { get; set; }
			    [Required]
			    [DataType(DataType.Password)]
			    public string Password { get; set; }
			    [Display(Name = "Remember me?")]
			    public bool RememberMe { get; set; }
			}
			//controller action (separate file)
			public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model, string returnUrl = null)
			{
			    if (ModelState.IsValid)
			    {
			      // work with the model
			    }
			    // At this point, something failed, redisplay form
			    return View(model);
			}
			```
	- **Dependency Injection**
		- controllers can request needed services through their constructors, allowing them to follow the Explicit Dependencies Principle.
		- used using `@inject` directive
		- 	```csharp
			@inject SomeService ServiceName
			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html lang="en">
			<head>
			    <title>@ServiceName.GetTitle</title>
			</head>
			<body>
			    <h1>@ServiceName.GetTitle</h1>
			</body>
			</html>
			```
	- **filters**
		- enable running custom pre- and post-processing logic for action method
		-  configured to run at certain points within the execution pipeline for a given request
		- applied to controllers or actions as attributes (or can be run globally)
		- e.g. [Authorize] is the attribute that is used to create MVC authorization filters.
		- 	```csharp
			[Authorize]
			   public class AccountController : Controller
			   {//something}
			```
	- **Areas**
		- way to partition a large ASP.NET Core MVC Web app into smaller functional groupings
		- MVC structure with Models, views, controllers separate folders
- Razor View Engine: render views
	- is a compact, expressive and fluid template markup language for defining views using embedded C# code. 
	- dynamically generate web content on server
		- 	```csharp
			<ul>
			  @for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
			    <li>List item @i</li>
			  }
			</ul>
			```
	- Tag helpers
		- enable server side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. 
			- define custom tags
			- modify the behavior of existing tags
		- bind to specific elements based on the element name and its attributes. 
		-  server-side rendering while still preserving an HTML editing experience.
		- authored in C#, and they target HTML elements based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag
		- 	```cshtml
			<p>
			    Thank you for confirming your email.
			    Please <a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Login">Click here to Log in</a>.
			</p>
			```
		- EnvironmentTagHelper can be used to include different scripts in your views (for example, raw or minified) based on the runtime environment,
			- 	```cshtml
				<environment names="Development">
				    <script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
				</environment>
				<environment names="Staging,Production">
				    <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"
				            asp-fallback-src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"
				            asp-fallback-test="window.jQuery">
				    </script>
				</environment>
				```

## Notes
- Database first EE
	- we define our model in SQL, and use tool to generate C# classes
- code first
	- define c# classes, use tool (migrations)
	- to generate sql db
- Add-Migration initial
- Update-Database

## configuring EF
- "right way" to do [database seeding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/data-seeding)
- generate Fake data use [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus)
- [tutorial on making ASP.CORE MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
- Apples, gotta go look over his code one by one later... 

```
 3 ways to configure EF
  1. conventions (e.g. properly named "Id" is primary key)
  2. fluent API (DbContext.OnModelCreating) (preferred way, keep entity classes clean, most powerful)
  3. DataAnnotations attributes 

steps for code-first EF:
 1. have separate data access class library project
 2. add nuget packages: Microsoft.EntityFrameWorkCore.SqlServer
      to both mvc app and data access library also
          Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools on data access library
 3. Implement your context class (inheriting from DBContext).
  a. need constructor receiving DbContextOptions
  b. need DBSets
  c. need onModelCreating
      
 4. add initial migrations(just like the db-first scaffolding, there is a "package Manager Conosole" way)
      - and dotnet CLI (dotnet ef) way also
      both requires nuget packages Microsoft.EntityFramewrokCore.Tools (.Dotnet)
 5. register DbContext in Startup.Configurations (using connection string from user secrets)
 6. update DB
```

## MVC stuffs
- Razor expressions
	- `@Model.Name, @(new Data{Name = "Bill"}.Name)`
	- the result of the c# expression is converted to string HTML encoded and inserted onto the HTML page
	- if there was `<Bill>` it will convert < and > into unicode
- Razor blocks
	- `@{var data = 5;}`
	- runs code during view render
	- doesn't inheriently insert anything to HTML
	- All control statements that works as if you expected
		- `@if @while @switch etc...`
		- HTML inside these will be conditionally/repetitively inserted
- Directives
	- `@model <type-name>`
	- makes the view strongly typed
		- a strongly typed view is generated from a model.
		- You can pass an empty model object to this view ,populate the object and send it back to the controller. 
		- Strongly-typed view has following advantages.1) Intellisense 2) Compile time type checking 3) Automatic scaffolding
- Comments
	- `@* *@` removed at render time
- tag helpers
	- HTML helpers to know
		- DisplayFor, DisplayNameFor, EditorFor, TextBoxFor, ActionLink, DropDownListFor
		- BeginForm
			- doesn't auto add anti-forgery-token
		- AntiForgeryToken
	- Tag helpers: a (anchor), asp-action, asp-controller, asp-route, asp-route-(paramname)
		- gives value for route parameter
	- input: asp-for, asp-items
	- select: asp-for
	- (span): asp-validation-for
	- form: asp-action
- e.g. `new { @class = "col-2-sm"}`
- **CSRF**: cross site request forgery
	- [my server]  <--Sends request-- (POST form)[client]
	- [my server]  --Sends response--> [client]
		- then there is a bad guy(middle man) who sends a counterfeit form 
	- way to solve this is to use tokens, and forms will reject post requests without a token
	- the filter [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] counters XSRF
- DataAnnotations:
	- attributes both EF and ASP.NET use for validation checks & other metdata
	- Required
	- MaxLength
	- Range
	- RegularExpression
	- DataType (zipcode, emailaddress, phone, password)
	- Display(Names =
	- :ValidationAttribute and be able to do from Required ... Regular expression from above
- **DI (dependency injection)**
	- in StartupConfigureServices
	- services.AddSingleton
		- one instance of the service for app's lifetime
	- services
		- .AddScoped
		- .AddDbContext
		- one instance for each HTTP request
	- services.AddTransient
		- one instance per ask
	- `if(Configuration["useDb"]{...AddDbContext; ...AddScoped<IRepo, DbRepo>();} else {AddScoped<IRepo, DbRepo>();}`
- ModelState.AddModelError( , );

## project 1
- same as project 0
- also client side and server side validation
