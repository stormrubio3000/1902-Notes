### Level 0
- usage of HTTP as transport system for remote interactions 
	- not using any mech. from web
	- usually through [Remote Procedure Invocation](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/EncapsulatedSynchronousIntegration.html)
- e.g. a hospital expose service endpoint at some URI and I post to the endpoint containing details of my reservation request
	- sends response of 200 OK back if good

### Level 1 - Resources
- we start talking to individual resources
- notion of object identity
	- call a method on one particular object providing arguments for the other information.
- e.g. we might have individual doctors

### Level 2 - HTTP Verbs
- We use HTTP verbs as closely as possible
- GET is defined as a safe operation
	- allows participants in routing of req. to use caching
- If using POST, could get a code 201 to show that there's a new resource
	- location attribute with URI
- 409 would be if someone update res in an incompatible way 
- strong separation between safe (eg GET) and non-safe operations, together with using status codes to help communicate the kinds of errors you run into

### Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls
- HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State)
- e.g. address how to get from list open slots to knowing what to do to book an appointment
- hypermedia controls tells us what we can do next
	- URI of res we need to manipulate to do it
- benefits
	- allows server to change its URI scheme w/o breaking clients
	- helps client dev explore the protocol
		- gives a hint to what may be possible next
	- advertise new capabilities by putting new links in the res

### Summary
- Level 1 tackles the question of handling complexity by using divide and conquer, breaking a large service endpoint down into multiple resources.
- Level 2 introduces a standard set of verbs so that we handle similar situations in the same way, removing unnecessary variation.
- Level 3 introduces discoverability, providing a way of making a protocol more self-documenting.
- As Ben said: Spot -> See Spot -> See Spot Run -> Run Spot Run

## SOAP, RPC, REST, and etc
- SOAP
	- message goes in POST req, in the body
	- protocol communicates using XML over a variety of transport protocol
		- rigorously define all needed info about service in a WSDL doc
- RPC 
	- "service.com/methodName?param1=23"
	- calling a method with params from URI
- HTTP 
	- has a lot of semantics that traditionally
		- websites implement partly 
			- GET for read, POST for write
			- and web services (SOAP, RPC)
				- ignore
		- REST follows HTTP semantics
- REST
	- representional state transfer
	- an architecture
	- communicates using many representations 
		- often JSON
		- over HTTP only
	- info of service either:
		1. not rigorously defined 
			- not really REST
		2. hypermedia/HATEOAS (110% REST)
			- next level after SOA
			- service itself evolves on runtime, where devs discovers new routes
		3. one of many API desc. lang.
			- like WSDL for SOAP
			-  e.g. OpenAPI/Swagger, API Blueprint
	- payoffs:
		- layered arch: payoff in 1 year
		- SOA: payoff in 3 years
		- hypermedia: payoff in 15 years

## REST Principles
- [principles from a website](https://restfulapi.net/)
	- there is a saying "there are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things."
	- there is a page on the sidebar for "naming resources" that is helpful for practical implementation (how to choose your URLs/controller names)
- **uniform interface**
	- *use HTTP semantically(according to proper meaning)* ~~heavy breathing sounds~~
		- in headers, method, and status code
	- identify res. 
		- have 1-to-1 relationships between URLs and res
	- distinguish res from its representations
- **client-server architecture**
	- make sure there is a client server separation, only the things he exposes
- **statelessness**
	- server is not going to store any state about the exchanges with the client
	- per req. stuff should not be stored in the server (no partial stuffs)
	- client is the one responsible to sending everything the server needs for the req
- **cacheability**
	- when http allows it, we should be able to cache res
	- if same req comes in, there should be the same res coming back
	- more we can cache, more we can scale up
- **layered system**
	- might be a number of servers in the middle. 
	- These servers might provide a security layer, a caching layer, a load-balancing layer, or other functionality. 
	- Those layers should not affect the request or the response.
- **code on demand**
	- optional
	- a client could req from server
	- response from the server will contain some code, usually in the form of a script, 
		- when the response is in HTML format. The client then can execute that code.

## HTTP methods/verbs, Constraints, Status Code
- **GET**
	- retrieval of res
- **POST**
	- creation of res
- **DELETE**
	- removal of res
- **PUT**
	- replacement of res
- **PATCH**
	- partial update of res
	- like you just want to edit user's name and not e-mail
- **HEAD** (optional)
	- like GET but without body, get only headers
	- want to test if res exists
- **OPTIONS** (optional)
	- tell me what methods I can use on this res
	- allow headers
- **TRACE** (optional)
	- asks the server to repeat the req back to you
	- used for diagnostics
	- make sure there's no one in middle not messing with the req
- Constraints
	- **safe**
		- "safe" methods should not change the system's state
		- on dev's shoulders, should not change anything that is visible
		- enables cacheability
		- methods
			- GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
	- [**idempotent**](https://restfulapi.net/idempotent-rest-apis/)
		- multiple copies of the same req 
			- have the same effect on the system state as only one req
		- methods
			- GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE
		- POST APIs are used to create a new resource on server. 
			- So when you invoke the same POST request N times, you will have N new resources on the server. 
			- So, POST is not idempotent.
		- 2 ways to implement functionality
			- allow set on and off operations (indempotent)
				- like a light switch
			- toggle operation (not indempotent)
- **HTTP Status Code**
	- [list of codes](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)
	- **bolded are the ones we should know**
	- 100-199	: informational
		- 100: continue
			- e.g. got header, but send rest of the body
	- 200-  	: success
		- **200**: OK generic success for GET responses
		- **201**: Created for POST responses (should also return res + location in res body)
		- **204**: No Content: for PUT, DELETE, PATCH
	- 300- 		: redirection
		- 301: Moved Permanently, gives a location header to find new place for res
		- **302**: Found; res not here, but at new location(not permanent), common browser redirect
		- 304: Not Modified; based on If-Modified-Since req had been made, for client side caching
	- 400-		: client error
		- **400**: Bad Request, generic client error
		- **401**: Unauthorized, for unauthenticated 
			- **authentication** means you prove who you are (about identity)
			- **authorization** means prove what you're allowed to do
		- 402: Payment Required
		- **403**: Forbidden, we are authenticated, but not authorized
		- **404**: Not Found
		- 405: Method Not Allowed
		- **406**: Not acceptable, server cannot provide any of the req formats
		- 418: I Am a Teapot
	- 500- 		: server error
		- **500**: Internal Server Error, general server error
		- 501: Not Implemented, (e.g. not implemented exception)
		- **502**: Bad Gateway, this server didn't have a problem, but some other server it was talking to did

### What is REST
- REpresentational State Transfer.
- 6 principles of REST AKA constraints
- resource
- resource methods
- data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).
	- resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations.
	- clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol – typically HTTP
	- decoupled from their representation so that their content can be accessed in a variety of formats, such as HTML, XML, plain text, PDF, JPEG, JSON, and others
- Resource: primary data representation
	- A resource can be a singleton or a collection
		- e.g “customers” collection resource using the URI “/customers”. 
			- We can identify a single “customer” resource using the URI “/customers/{customerId}”.
	- resource may contain sub-collection resources
		- “/customers/{customerId}/accounts”
		- singleton resource “account” inside the sub-collection resource “accounts”
			- “/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}” 
	- Best Naming Practice
		- RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing (noun) instead of referring to an action (verb) because nouns have properties which verbs do not have
		- divide resource archetypes into four categories (document, collection, store and controller) 
			- target to put a resource into one archetype and then use it’s naming convention consistently. 
			- **document**: singular concept that is akin to an object instance or database record
				- includes both fields with values and links to other related resources.
				- `http://api.example.com/user-management/users/{id}`
			- **collection**: server-managed directory of resources
				- Use “plural” name to denote collection resource archetype.
				- `http://api.example.com/user-management/users`
				- `http://api.example.com/user-management/users/{id}/accounts`
			- **store**: client-managed resource repository
				- lets an API client put resources in, get them back out, and decide when to delete them.
				- Use “plural” name to denote store resource archetype
				- `http://api.example.com/cart-management/users/{id}/carts`
				- `http://api.example.com/song-management/users/{id}/playlists`
			- **controller**: Controller resources are like executable functions, with parameters and return values; inputs and outputs.
				- Use “verb” to denote controller archetype.
				- `http://api.example.com/cart-management/users/{id}/cart/checkout`
				- `http://api.example.com/song-management/users/{id}/playlist/play`
