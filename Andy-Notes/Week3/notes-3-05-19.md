# Revature notes 3-05-19
This is the ASP.NET, MVC, HTML, CSS Week! Woohoo!

## HTML
- Stands for: *Hyper Text Markup Lanuguage*
- old HTML -> HTML4
	- browser wars back then, where each browsers each had their own version of HTML
	- Now more standardized in HTML4 where HTML is shared across browsers (not all)
		- first version to include cascading style sheets as part of the HTML standard
		- HTML4 is now reliant on style sheets to provide precise control of data within the page.
	- HTML4 -> XHTML
		- Idea of giving structure: strict subset of XML
		- error handling well defined
		- XXXXXXX we skipped XHTML and went straight to HTML5 XXXXXXXXXX
	- HTML4 -> HTML5
		- living standard
			- W3C, WWW Consortium
			- WHATWG: Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
			- Consistency in Handling Malformed Documents
			- Better Web Application Features
			- Improved Element Semantics
- Separation of Concerns
	- HTML
		- structure, semantics
		- text content
	- CSS
		- Cascading Style sheets
		- tells us about appearance, layout, presentation
	- JavaScript
		- dynamic client side behavior
- Syntax
	- Element: `<tagname attributename = "attribute-value"> contents </tagname>` 
		- `input` and `img` doesn't have closing tags 
			- self-closing tag `<input attr="val" />`
		- if you need list of values in attr: space separated
			- e.g. `data = "1 2 3"`
	- Attributes: some 'global'
		- `id, class, title, style, "on _" event handlers`
			- id: identifier for this element, unique on page
			- class: groups of elements for css/js to target
			- title: hover tool tip text
			- style: inline css (bad in a sense)
- Browser -> sends request for page and receives back an ip address
	- goes to DNS and finds ip address of the webpage and sends it back
	- Browser -> server: GET /index.html, http request
		- GET: method/verb 
		- we get back a HTTP response
- Forms uses POST method and not GET method
	- (response body)
		- has things like name = "bob", email = `"a@gmail.moc"`
	- at end of URL after ? is a query

## CSS 
- cascading style sheets
- composed of rules
	- `table, th, td { border 1px solid black; }`
		- all of that is a rule
		- selectors are `table, th, td`
		- border is a property, and then there are values (the whole thing is a property as well)
- Selectors: 
	- `*` 		  
		- `*` all elements
	- tags	 	  
		- `div` all with tag (all divs)
	- .class	  
		- `.apple` all with class apple(all class="apple")
	- #id 		  
		- #id23 the one with id (id="id23")
	- [attr=val]  
		- `[src=logo.png]` all with attribute set to value
	- `[attr~=val]`
		- `[class~=asdf]` all with attr containng val
- selector combination
	- `,` 
		- `p,div` all mathing **either** selector (OR) 
	- `.`
		- `p.login` all matching **both** selectors (AND) (all p elements with class login)
	- ` `
		- `div p` (ancestor descendant) all matching 2nd selector that are descendants of some matching first selector
	- `>`
		- `p>div` (parent child) all matching 2nd selector that are children of some matching first selector
	- `+`
		- `P+P` (next sibling) all matching 2nd selector that are siblings after some matching first selector
	- `~`
		- `P~P` (any sibling) all matching 2nd selector that any sibling matching first selector
- pseudo-class
	- select elements in same state
	- at end of selector
	- :valid
	- :invalid
	- :link
	- :visited
	- :active
	- :focus
	- :hover
	- :nth-child(aN+b)
		- e.g. nth-child(2N) and nth-child(2N+1)
		- make every color of a difference color in some sequence as e.g.
	- :first-child
	- :last-child
	- `:not(<selector>)`
- pseudo-element
	- `::` 
		- `<selector> :: before`
		-			  :: after
		- e.g. a.external :: after { content: "someContent" }
		- `:: selection` (what the user is highlighting)
- cascade
	- when multiple rules set the same properties on an element, which one wins?
		1. importance: `!important` (bad practice)
		2. specificity:
			- inline styles -> more # -> more . -> more tag wins
		3. source order: later rules overrides older rules
- user-agent styles
	- browser defaults (e.g. user agent is chrome, firefox etc)
- author styles (us)
	- overrides user agent styles
	- CSS included on documents
	- 	```css
			<head>
				<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="theme.css">
			</head>
		```
	- internal styles
		- `<style> p{ font-weight: bold; } </style>`
	- inline styles
		- `<p style="border: 1px solid black;">Something</p>`

## BOX MODEL
- every element within a doc is structured in a rectangular box inside doc layout
- margin, border, padding, content
	- can edit: top, right, bottom, left
	- some shortcuts: 
		- `margin: 2px` to apply to all 4, `margin: 1px 2px;` applies 1 top and bot and 2 left and right


### Good resources 
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
- w3Schools isn't as reliable https://www.w3schools.com/
- [specificity calculator](https://specificity.keegan.st/)

## Project QC
- introduce yourself
- explain purpose of project
- explain technology used
	- e.g. C#, SQL Server DB with Azure and connected with Entity Framework
- demoing project
	- placing order
	- some customization
	- input validation (doesn't break code)
