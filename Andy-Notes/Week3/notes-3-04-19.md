## Questions
- cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal?' to 'decimal'
- System.InvalidOperationException: 'The instance of entity type 'StoreOrder' cannot be tracked because another instance with the same key value for {'OrderId'} is already being tracked. When attaching existing entities, ensure that only one entity instance with a given key value is attached. Consider using 'DbContextOptionsBuilder.EnableSensitiveDataLogging' to see the conflicting key values.'
