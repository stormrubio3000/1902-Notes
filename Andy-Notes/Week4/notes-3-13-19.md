# Notes 3-13-19

## SDLC Approach to SW deployment
- [Source Repo] <--> [devs]
- [Package Repo]
	- sometimes we lose our source, so we like to have previous working compiled version
- [Devs] --> [IT] --> [Package Repo]
- [IT] -> [Dev Server] -> [Dev]
	- "source of truth": everyone agrees that it works and if it doesn't work on dev server, then it's problem with a dev's computer
		- Github is a source of truth 
		- we have to ask the IT to give us info from dev server
- [IT] --> [Test server] <--> [QA]
	- make sure tests are good 
- [Test Server] --> (Operation (ops)) --> [Staging Server] --> [Production Server]
	- Ops are resistant to change, 
	- IT is the middleman between all of these

## DevOps
- an extension of Agile values to deployment + maintainence all the way to production
- Using automation using params agreed upon by dev ops stakeholders
	- deploy freq. and with quality via automated checks
- people, process, product
- deploy to dev server on every change
- stages
	1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
		- very freq., each dev's code is integrated with the others with automatic checks
			- code should build/compile
			- tests should pass
			- static analysis
		- any VCS/SCM
		- build pipeline stuffs
			- automated pipeline
				- to fetch latest code from Github
			- fetch dependencies (dotnet restore)
			- build code (dotnet build)
			- run tests
			- static analysis (sonar cloud)
			- package the code (dotnet publish)
			- deploy to azure
			- notify of errors
			- App source
	2. **Continuous delivery (CD, CDE)**
		- automated deployment all the way to production server
			- with some manual approvals before production
	3. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
		- 100% auto to production
		- clients can view what you have available

## azure dev ops
- make new pipeline
- then search azure web apps 
- then now click on github side keep defaults
- agent job clicked
- check 'use nuget'
- `**\*.sln` searches for sln files in project, great if only one
- build solution: workable on both .net framework and core
	- back then how we used to offer to MSBuild
	- defaults good
- VsTests
	- looking for all files that has test in their name
	- `**\$(BuildConfiguration)\*test*.dll !**\obj\**`
	- **Enable Code Coverage**
- Azure app service deploy
	- provide your azure subscription
		- need to put in pipeline params
- build and git moves stuffs into our build
	- what comes out is called **artifacts**
		- `artifact` is a document or some result of some process that has some version we keep track of 
			- [build] -> artifact -> [release]
			- saved and triggers release once done
			- nothing gets out of build except artifacts
		- drop is its name
		- artifactstagingdirectory
- variables are good
- triggers already set by default
	- triggers on builds
	- enable continuous integration
		- where we push a series of commits together and then they batch all the commit together instead of a queue
	- enable pull request validation
		- when someone wants to post into master, build pipeline can do it for you
		- enable it
	- build pull requests from forks of repo, bad, since they can access your secrets and push to master
	- can make scheduled builds, like a commit every half hour
- options has a status badge you can use to reflect status of build
- retention has options for what we want to do wtih the logs
	- keep, remove etc after x time
- History shows what each person did and who broke the code
- Now Save and Queue
- if encounter
	- `##[warning]No test assemblies found matching the pattern: **\release\*test*.dll,!**\obj\**.`
		- change in VsTest test to Test 
	- assembly error: change release in variables to Release

## SonarQube
- software for static analysis, going to look carefully at the code
	- find problems, security flaws, bad practices
- SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities
- Azure Devops uses SonarQube (SonarCloud) -> app(VM) (App Service)
- [Sonar Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/about) link with your github
	- setup manually
	- then generate by default
		- save it: for now: `8fc24935122e24f1739502dad9fc7072d1e36b78` for andy1902project1
		- then continue on, don't download anything!
- [SonarQube Server] <- [SonarQube Scanner] `(scans the code)`
	- scanners for each different languages
	- server applies rules, builds analysis
- [SonarQube docs](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+MSBuild)
- 	```
	dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
	dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"project-key(which is the name of proj)"
	// have to double initial / to make things work
	dotnet build <path to solution.sln>
	dotnet sonarscanner end
	```
	- add // but will throw exceptions
		- need to add token
		- dotnet sonarscanner begin with full things below
			- `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"andy1902project1" /o:"birisora-github" /d:sonar.host.url="https://sonarcloud.io" /d:sonar.login="8fc24935122e24f1739502dad9fc7072d1e36b78"`
		- now `dotnet build --no-incremental <Project name>` 
		- `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="8fc24935122e24f1739502dad9fc7072d1e36b78"`
			- apparently you need to install java

## back to azure webdev
	- apply things above
	- going on and off breain meltdown
	- query section be advance
- search sonar tasks
	- prepare analysis before build
	- run and publish after build and test
	- click +New
		- connection name: sonarcloud
		- add sonarcloud service connecton, click go to generate a token
	- integrate with MSBuild
	- add in project key and etc
	- sonarcloud : 9b9f7d27846dbfcca63d31fe586220aef05ed573
		- projectkey: andyproject1, name: project1
	- make sure have in right order (you took a pic)
		- use NuGet
		- NuGet restore
		- prepare analysis on SonarCloud
		- build solution `**\*.sln`
		- vsTest
		- run code analysis
		- publish quality gate result
		- azure app service deploy
		- publish symbols path
		- publish artifact drop
- technical debt
	- wrote badly back then, not has to fix it up
- coverage basically telling you need to test more
- Quality profile: are collections of rules to apply during an analysis.
For each language there is a default profile. All projects not explicitly assigned to some other profile will be analyzed with the default. Ideally, all projects will use the same profile for a language.
- Quality gate: Only project measures are checked against thresholds. Directories and files are ignored.
- .gitignore .sonarqube/
