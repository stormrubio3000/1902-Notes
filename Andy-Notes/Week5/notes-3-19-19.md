remember to update your gitignore to include sonarqube and etc

## Service oriented architecture
- next level for separation of concerns/loose coupling
- split applications into web services
	- instead of linking our layers at build time as DLLs
		- will communicate at runtime over the web
		- lots of protocol can go over the internet besides HTTP
		- some website has services that exposes data to be used (APIs in general)
			- API or web API are synonyms for web services
			- expose and consume services
				- expose is when we expose our app for other clients to be able to use
				- consume is being able to use the services from our app
- SOAP
	- used to stand for Simple Object Access Protocol now just means SOAP literally
		- don't want to make SOAP only object oriented
	- used to be the standard for web services, now mostly replaced with REST
	- communicates using XML over a variety of protocols
		- rigorously define all needed info about the service about service in WSDL document
			- **WSDL**: web services description language
	- `[web service] (server) -> (client) [MVC] (server) -> (client) [browser]`
		- browser can also communicate directly with web service
- REST
	- which we'll use for our project yay!
	- REpresentational State Transfer

## JavaScript
- when apples now has arms to hurt people

## Visual Studios stuffs with SOAP
- WCF: windows communication foundation framework
	- hosting SOAP services
- Every soap message (XML)
	- has Envelope
	- has optional Header
	- has body which is required
	- close Envelope
- 	```XML
	<s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
	  <s:Header />
	  <s:Body>
	    <GetServiceVersionResponse xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">
	      <GetServiceVersionResult>1.0.0</GetServiceVersionResult>
	    </GetServiceVersionResponse>
	  </s:Body>
	</s:Envelope>
	```
	- xmlns stands for xml name space, and s would represent namespace
- XML supports xml schema
	- schema is the structure of the database
	- adds a required structure to XML including data types
	- also supports namespace
- WCF binding is asking: What protocol will we use and what port?
	- `<wsdl:binding name="BasicHttpBinding_IService1" type="tns:IService1">`
	- port type defines service interface
- Address is what URL are we going to find our service at
	-	```
		<wsdl:service name="Service1">
			<wsdl:port name="BasicHttpBinding_IService1" binding="tns:BasicHttpBinding_IService1">
				<soap:address location="http://localhost:58647/Service1.svc"/>
			</wsdl:port>
		</wsdl:service>
		```
- Contract what are all operations/messages you support?
- wsdl pronouced as wiz dull
- don't confuse wsdl with SOAP
- [More on WSDL](https://crunchify.com/basic-wsdl-structure-understanding-wsdl-explained/)
- soap services supports ACID
- moving away from SOAP since XML is too verbose

## REST
- less time to spend parsing JSON than XML, less overhead to data format
- does this mean we get more sleep for our project? No all nighters? Please
- [Install Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
	- if localhost doesn't work then you would want to go to settings and turn off for SSL
		- bad idea, but we're developers, we break things
- `[Server] <-http request- [Client]`
- `[Server] -http response-> [Client]`
	- GET, POST (has a body), etc...
- how we tested with Postman is we created a .Net Core ASP.NET Core Web Application
	- then edit controller so that we can test with postman that uses the localhost URL
- we make a new project for REST from .NET Core Console
	- install package for NewtonSoft.Json
	- **make sure to look at Nick's code for this section**
		- get all characters (add a method)
		- add a character (add a method)
		- print the characters (add a method)
		- get all chars await headers of the response
		- throw an exception if status code indicates failure
		- await the whole body of the response
		- deserialize the body
