# Notes 4/4/19

## What to do
- Assigned for statistics
- https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165127564
- Here is a link to a user story you can be working on @Andy Ly. Make sure you create a branch for the user story itself and then a separate branch off of that one that you are working on
- remember in forecast to comment out existed in seeder or rename

## Problems found
- fake seed data for bar chart they reversed date and time for Reston and New York
	- unless they really wanted to do from latest to least latest

## what to implement
- within the API, add a statistics model that contains the logic needed to calculate average
- also within the UI, make it so it takes two user input for dates
	- drop down list from list of dates
