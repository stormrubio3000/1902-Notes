## Apple Pies

## Project 0
- Technologies used (c#, Azure etc)
- QC on Wednesday next week from today's date
- Explain project is in high level 
- show what can be done with the project
	- what it does
- design considerations
- problems you overcame
- testing you have done

## SQL stuffs
- Cross Join
	- every row of each table will be paired with every other row in other table
	- multiply num of rows from one table with num of rows of other table
		- e.g. 6 and 2 = 12
- inner join
	- keep some rows that matches the condition
	- usually primary key = foreign key
	- don't include rows that don't have corresponding part
- Outer Join
	- Left Join: preserve everything in left table
	- Right Join: preserve everything in right table
	- Full Join: Don't want to lose any data from both tables, anything missing is filled with Null

### Basic SQL Exercises
```sql
--1. list all customers (full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
--2. list all customers from brazil
--3. list all sales agents
--4. show a list of all countries in billing addresses on invoices.
--5. how many invoices were there in 2009, and what was the sales total for that year? (extra challenge: find the invoice count sales total for every year, using one query)
--6. how many line items were there for invoice #37?
--7. how many invoices per country?
--8. show total sales per country, ordered by highest sales first.

SELECT *
FROM dbo.Customer

-- 1. list all customers (full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM dbo.Customer
WHERE Country != 'USA';

--2. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Customer
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employee
WHERE Title = 'Sales Manager';

--4
SELECT BillingCountry
FROM dbo.Invoice
GROUP BY BillingCountry;

--5. how many invoices were there in 2009, and what was the sales total for that year? (extra challenge: find the invoice count sales total for every year, using one query)
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) as Count, SUM(Total) as [Total Sales]
FROM dbo.Invoice
WHERE InvoiceDate >= '2009' AND InvoiceDate < '2010'

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) as Count, SUM(Total) as [Total Sales]
FROM dbo.Invoice
GROUP BY YEAR(InvoiceDate);

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) as Count, SUM(Total) as [Total Sales]
FROM Invoice
--WHERE DATEPART(YEAR, InvoiceDate) = 2009;
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009' AND '2010';

SELECT YEAR(InvoiceDate) AS YEAR, COUNT(InvoiceDate) AS Count, Sum(Total) as TotalCost
FROM Invoice
GROUP BY YEAR(InvoiceDate);

SELECT SUM(Quantity) as [Total Quantity]
FROM dbo.InvoiceLine
Where InvoiceId = 37

--7. how many invoices per country?
--SELECT *

--SELECT *
--FROM dbo.Invoice;
SELECT BillingCountry as Country, SUM(Total) as [Total Sales]
FROM dbo.Invoice
GROUP BY BillingCOuntry

``` 

### SQL Joins
```sql
-- joins

-- cross join
-- example: Subways: bread x meat x add ons x sauce = a ton of possibilities

SELECT e1.*, e2.*
FROM Employee AS e1 CROSS JOIN Employee AS e2


-- most common join, inner
-- most common condition for inner join: foreign key = primary key
SELECT *
FROM Track INNER JOIN Genre ON Track.GenreId = Genre.GenreId;

-- joining on 'true' is the same as a cross join
SELECT * 
FROM Track INNER JOIN Genre ON 1 = 1;

-- 3 kinds of outer join: left outer, right outer, full outer
SELECT  Track.Name, Genre.Name
FROM Track RIGHT JOIN Genre ON Track.GenreId = Genre.GenreId

SELECT  t.Name, g.Name
FROM Track t RIGHT JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId;

-- all rock songs in db, showing full artist name and song name
SELECT ar.Name + ' - ' + t.name
FROM Track as t
	INNER JOIN Album as a1 on t.AlbumId = a1.AlbumId
	INNER JOIN Artist AS ar ON a1.ArtistId = ar.artistId
	INNER JOIN Genre AS g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE g.Name = 'Rock'

-- Every employeetogether with who he reports to (his manager) if any
SELECT *
FROM Employee AS emp
	LEFT OUTER JOIN Employee AS mgr ON emp.ReportsTo = mgr.EmployeeId;

-- JOIN EXERCISES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--1. show all invoices of customers from brazil (mailing address not billing)
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, I.*
FROM Invoice as I
	JOIN Customer AS c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country = 'Brazil'

--2. show all invoices together with the name of the sales agent of each one
SELECT i1.InvoiceId, e1.FirstName, e1.LastName
FROM Invoice AS i1
	INNER JOIN Customer AS c ON c.CustomerId = i1.CustomerId
	INNER JOIN Employee AS e1 ON e1.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId;

--3. show all playlists ordered by the total number of tracks they have
SELECT pl.Name, COUNT(pl.PlaylistId)
FROM Playlist AS pl
	INNER JOIN PlaylistTrack AS plt ON plt.PlaylistId = pl.PlaylistId
GROUP BY pl.PlaylistId, pl.Name;

--4. which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?
--5. how many customers are assigned to each sales agent?
--6. which track was purchased the most since 2010?
--7. show the top three best-selling artists.
--8. which customers have the same initials as at least one other customer?



-- subqueries

-- another way besides joins to combine info from multiple tables
SELECT *
FROM Track AS t
WHERE t.TrackId NOT IN (
	SELECT TrackId
	FROM Invoice
);

--// here we have a subquery in the WHERE clause of another query
-- we have operators IN, NOT IN

SELECT t.Name
FROM Track as t
WHERE t.TrackId = (
	SELECT TOP(1) TrackId
	FROM InvoiceLine
	GROUP BY TrackId
	ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
);

-- We have TOP(n) to take just the first n results of a query
-- the inner query is: get the top trackid when we group all the invoicelines
-- by trackid and count up how many in each group

-- we can also have subqueries in HAVING (no difference)
-- but also in FROM clause

SELECT * 
FROM Track INNER JOIN(
		SELECT Artist.Name AS Artist, Album.Title AS Album, Album.AlbumId As AlbumId
		FROM Artist JOIN Album ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId
	) AS subq ON Track.AlbumId = subq.Album
WHERE Track.Name < 'b';

-- similar to subquery in FROM is 'common table expression' (CTE)
-- which uses a "WITH" clause
WITH purchased_tracks AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT TrackId
	FROM InvoiceLine
)
SELECT *
FROM Track AS t
WHERE t.TrackId NOT IN (
	SELECT TrackId
	FROM purchased_tracks
);

-- some other subquery operators
-- EXISTS, NOT EXISTS
-- SOME/ANY, ALL

-- get the artists who made the album with longest title
SELECT * 
FROM Artist
WHERE ArtistId = (
	SELECT ArtistId
	FROM Album
	WHERE LEN(Title) >= ALL (SELECT LEN(Title) FROM Album)
)

SELECT *
FROM Artist
WHERE ArtistId = (
	SELECT TOP(1) ArtistId
	FROM Album
	ORDER BY LEN(Title) DESC
);

-- SET operations 
-- have from mathematical sets the concepts of 
-- UNION, INTERSECT, and (set differences) EXCEPT

-- all first names of customers and emloyees
SELECT FirstName FROM Customer
UNION
SELECT FirstName FROM Employee --67 with dupes, 63 without

-- all rows of the first query and also all rows of the 2nd query
-- (the number and types of the col need to be compatible)

-- For each set op, we have a distinct version and an ALL version
-- the DISTINCT version is the default
--	so by default all these ops makes a pass to remove dupes row from result


-- UNITON gives you values that are in EITHER result
-- INTERSECT gives you values that are in BOTH results
-- EXCEPT gives you values that are in the FIRST but NOT the SECOND result
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SET JOIN EXERCISES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--1. which artists did not make any albums at all?
--2. which artists did not record any tracks of the Latin genre?
--3. which video track has the longest length? (use media type table)
--4. find the names of the customers who live in the same city as the boss employee (the one who reports to nobody)
--5. how many audio tracks were bought by German customers, and what was the total price paid for them?
--6. list the names and countries of the customers supported by an employee who was hired younger than 35.
```

### SQL DML
```sql
-- SQL has many statements/commands
-- categorized as a num of sub languages

-- data manipulation language (DML) operaates on individ rows
-- 5 DML commands in SQL server

-- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, (TRUNCATE)(??? depends on what truncate is used for)
-- truncate if removes all rows in table is DML,
-- otherwise if used to create new table then it's DDL

-- SELECT is for read access to the rows

SELECT * FROM Genre;
-- INSERT (simple)
INSERT INTO Genre VALUES (26, 'MISC');

-- really we should name the col
-- this is more readable/ less err prone
-- and lets us skip col that have default values we are ok with
INSERT INTO Genre (GenreId, Name) VALUES 
(
(SELECT MAX(GenreId) FROM Genre) + 1,
'MISC 3'
);

-- can insert multiple rows at once
INSERT INTO Genre (GenreId, Name) VALUES
	(29, 'MISC 4'),
	(30, 'MISC 5');

-- can insert the result of a query 
-- (this one duplicates every genre)
INSERT INTO Genre (GenreId, Name)
	(SELECT GenreId + 100, Name
	FROM Genre);

-- UPDATE statement
UPDATE Genre
SET Name = 'Misc 1' -- could change more than one column, comma separated
WHERE Name = 'Misc';

-- if we left out the WHERE, we would change every row

-- take the high ID copies of my MISC genres,
-- lower the IDs, and rename them to say Miscellaneous
UPDATE Genre
SET GenreId = GenreId - 50, Name = 'Miscellaneous ' + SUBSTRING(Name, 6, 1)
WHERE GenreId > 100 AND Name LIKE 'Misck'

SELECT 'Miscellaneous ' + SUBSTRING(Name, 6, 1)
FROM Genre

-- DELETE statement
DELETE FROM Genre
WHERE GenreId > 100; -- without where, would delete every row

-- TRUNCATE TABLE
-- TRUNCATE TABLE Genre; 
-- -- deletes every row, no conditions

-- DELETE FROM Genre deletes every row, one at a time
-- TRUNCATE TABLE Genre deletes every row all at once, faster


-- EXERCISES
--1. insert two new records into the employee table.
SELECT *
FROM Employee
INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, Title, ReportsTo, BirthDate, HireDate, Address, City, State, Country, PostalCode, Phone, Fax, Email)
VALUES
(9, 'Star', 'Joe', 'Stand User', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'jojojo Adventures', 'somewhere', 'KK', 'someCountry', 'T11111', '+1 (222)222-2222', '+1(333)333-3333', 'js@gmail.com'),
(10, 'Starrrr', 'Joeeee', 'Stand User', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'jojojo Adventures', 'somewhere', 'KK', 'someCountry', 'T11111', '+1 (222)222-2222', '+1(333)333-3333', 'js@gmail.com')
--2. insert two new records into the tracks table.
SELECT * 
FROM Track
INSERT INTO Track (TrackId, Name, AlbumId, MediaTypeId, GenreId, Composer, Milliseconds, Bytes, UnitPrice) VALUES
(3504, 'blah', 1, 1, 1, NULL, 7777, 9393993, 5.99),
(3505, 'blah2', 1, 1, 1, NULL, 7777, 9393993, 5.99)

--3. update customer Aaron Mitchell's name to Robert Walter
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE FirstName = 'Aaron'

UPDATE Customer
SET FirstName = 'Robert', LastName = 'Walter'
WHERE FirstName = 'Aaron' AND LastName = 'Mitchell'

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE FirstName = 'Robert'

--4. delete one of the employees you inserted.
DELETE FROM Track
WHERE TrackId = 3505;
SELECT * 
FROM Track

--5. delete customer Robert Walter. (more complex than it seems!)
DELETE FROM Customer
WHERE FirstName = 'Robert' AND LastName = 'Walter'
-- to preserve referential integrity, the DB throws an error
-- could set those FK values to NULL, or, we could delete all of them

-- so we need to remove all invoices that ref Robert 
-- and all invoice lines that ref those invoices
-- but in reverse order, deleting robert is last step
```
