## SQL stuffs
- Cross Join
	- every row of each table will be paired with every other row in other table
	- multiply num of rows from one table with num of rows of other table
		- e.g. 6 and 2 = 12
- inner join
	- keep some rows that matches the condition
	- usually primary key = foreign key
	- don't include rows that don't have corresponding part
- Outer Join
	- Left Join: preserve everything in left table
	- Right Join: preserve everything in right table
	- Full Join: Don't want to lose any data from both tables, anything missing is filled with Null
