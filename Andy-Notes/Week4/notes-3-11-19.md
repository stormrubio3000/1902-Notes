# Notes 3-11-19


## Project 1
- implement order
- check for user input in url
- exceptions and validation
- logger
- testing repo with mock

## Github
- git merges
- strategies
	- commit often, pull often, push often
- git issues
- git fork: makes new repo entirely (copies over the commits)
- pull request === merge request
	- is a request to merge a branch to another branch, which stays "open" and
		- tracks both branches
		- summarize diff, etc, until the user with authority over the target branch merges the PR
