Display Property - inline, block
can drop on in element or tag and just make them inline or block and act like it.
also inline-block which is a compromise that does?
also none which deletes the object as if it wasn't there at all

similar as none you have visibility: hidden         still takes up space but that space is blank


Position property - default is static 
Relative - activates - left,right,top,bottom depending on other objects
absolute - uses left,right,top,and bottom too. offsets to the parent element not the other objects around it.
fixed - left,right,top,bottom too. fixes the element to the overall viewpoint not just its parent element.


CSS Layout Tools - flexable box layout(flex box) - like making a drink by parats?
Grid Layout - setting things in a grid?
column layout - like columns......... I guess

color means foreground color.
background-color - is the background color. Well I mean I hope it is.
font-family - has generic like 'sans-serif'. can list them and it will try to use them in order depending on what it knows.
font-weight - bolding
font-style - italics


Inheritance - when property is set on an element it is also set on all children elements.
well most things it kinda just figures out whats best. like color is but inline vs block is not. border is not


CSS resets - purpose is to take away and remove all of the browser user defaults that way you have 'perfect' control
of how the website will look specifically

Normalize.css - Google it. because it doesn't remove defaults but changes them to a 'resonable' baseline.

Adaptive Design - write many CSS files. Basically one per resolution.

Responsive Design - 1 CSS file. Page will automatically reformat without refresh based on things like media query.
is more and more the standard expectation of web design now. Hard to make by oneself. 
Often use libraries to help get it done. Like BootStrap.


Media Query - applys something based on things the user has. Like User Ascpect ratio. Or height and width.
Can address things and change setup with things for like desktop with mouse vs touchscreen on mobile
Print Preview - reformats the page for better printing. uses a screentype?


Bootstrap - is JS as well as CSS. Based on a 12 column grid inherently. Nicely Divisable. 
Just apply classes to elements and it does things. Just have to follow documentation.

ASP.NET includes Bootstrap by default. 

ASP.NET is microsofts brand name for their web stuff.

/////////////////////////////////////////////download .NET CORE SDK///////////////////////////////


all based on server and client. client sends a request via browser. to web server (IIS Express)

Active Server Pages - "Web Forms" .aspx have special syntax inside them. that connects to .NET code
web forms had poor serperation of concerns. 

ASAP.NET MVC - framework for building apps in .Net with strong seperation of concerns using the MVC design pattern.
not to be confused with the other MVC? 

MVC - Model View Controller. is a design pattern. 
Model - Object oriented data. Data sent to or received from the client. 
Views - Templates for the HTML. Layout. Apperence. + CSS and JS.
Controller - Objects that receive requests from clients. Then combine approriate models and views to create response.

Model gets from controller and view.
view gets from controller and gives to model.
controller gives to model and view.

= means default.

there is another web server that is a container directly for app which is called kestrel.
IIS Express is the launcher to the browser. it is a web server.


ASP.NET creates a webhost and runs it using config from startup class

Here we register services that we can later request from framework
and we can use that for dependency injection



app.useMVC  - where we config convention based routing.
routing is the process/rules by which crontroller and action method will be instiated and called to jandle request.

defaults: new {controler = "home", Action = "Index"}

uses anon class. just kinda poof an object with what you give it.

no compile erros when like spell things wrong. Just kinda fails at runtime.

after your local host number and the / is what you can type in and that is where it looks for a matching controller

mvc checks route conventions 1 by 1 in order looking for a match. Can have a 404 page at the end to catch everything.

web doesn't care about case sensitivity

routes in config are where we pick the controllers

in RAZOR
@* is the comment.

@{   lets you completely do code in c#
@*( works too I think

@RenderBody()    is where the index/action thing is going to be called.
everything else in the view is just CSS formatting stuff. Well plus razor stuff that has other stuff in it.

can edit views even while the program is running and the view will update on a save refresh not only a full restart.
Not the c# running classes though. Thats a no no apparently.


a view can only have 1 model.
@model is how you pass a model to a view           like @model.username 









ya sorry zoning hard kinda done for today. Just ned to look at all of his HelloMVC code on the git.






making a form in index can do fancy rasor stuff. Aka <form asp-action="IndexwithID">   action is going to be in your controllers
											aka letting you give values through to a view.
						stuff
						     </form>



so he made a new MVC that he ended with .app

Then added a new solution for .BLL   aka what he is using as the data models for the database. kinda.

made a movie class with stuff. then a genre class with stuff. then a class as a repository

made all the functions in repo.

right click on the controllers folder. pick the mvc read write one. aka second option

once code is generated. Right click on the action result thing. Then click add view and pick the function you are using.

start up app has to have dependency reference the library.

Then it auto generates fucking everything. Have to give it a model first. Into the view.
so action reseult that you are using just make a new thing in there and give it the repo thing as a passed object.

in the shared folder layout thing is the header and footer and can edit them by just changing controller and action.
