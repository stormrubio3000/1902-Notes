# Revature Notes for 2/28/19

## SQL stuffs!
- Multiplicity
	- 1 to 1 	-> 1 table, or 2 tables, FK UNIQUE
	- 1 to N 	-> 2 tables - FK NOT NULL
	- 0/1 to N 	-> 2 tables FK NULL
	- N to N 	-> 3 tables, the middle one "junction table", "join table" with 2 FK
		- both going away from junction table
- **transaction**
	- a sequence of operations performed (using one or more SQL statements) on a database as a single logical unit of work
	- every statment is a transaction
	- **ACID**
		- A: *atomic*, all operations succeed 100% or do nothing at all 
		- C: *consistent*, operations should not be allowed to violate constraints
		- I: *isolated*, even if multiple transactions run concurrently, it should be AS IF each was running alone (transactions shouldn't interfere with each other)
		- D: *durable*, transactions incomplete until written to persistent storage (written to hard disk in some fashion)
		- e.g. `INSERT INTO Table VALUE; (   ), (   ), ( ERROR (~~~))`
			- SELECT: check account balance, UPDATE: withdraw funds, UPDATE: deposit in other account
	- From Table 1, higher up is more performance, further down is more isolation
	- Multi statement transaction
		- BEGIN TRANSACTION
			- U
			- U  IF ~
			- S  	ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
		- COMMIT TRANSACTION; 

### Tables

| Issue                                                                                    | Isolation level that fixes issue  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                                                                          | read_uncommitted                  |
| dirty read (see other transactions unfinished work)                                      | read_committed (default)          |
| nonrepeatable read (read row twice, another finished transaction changed it in between)  | repeatable_read                   |
| Phantom read (other transactions can insert  rows that meet conditions I'm filtering on) | serializable                      |

## SQL in VISUAL STUDIOS
- install in nuget System.Data.SqlClient
- in case [Forgot connections](https://www.connectionstrings.com/)
	- in our case [Azure](https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-azure/)
- remember to use .gitignore for the class we're using for our private informations

## Other SQL:
- object relational impedance mismatch
- object relational mapper
	- Java: Hibernate
	- .NET has Identity Framework (IF)
	- NHibernate, Dapper
- currently at Entity framework 6
	- .NET framework: EF6
	- .NET Core EF Core 2.2
		- lazy loading
		- many to many without a class for the junction table
	- Fluent API(Application program interface): where the result is formulated by method chaining.
		- method chaining: is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results
- database-first
- code genration, and scaffolding
- when ref. integrity would be violated
	- delete
	- update
	- we can handle in 3 ways
		1. (default) raise error
		2. cascade (e.g. c -> i -> isomething and you delete c, it'll get rid of the whole thing)
		3. set null (requires a nullable column)

## Entity Framework Setting up:
- EF DB first approach steps
	1. have startup project and data access library project
	2. reference data access from startup project
	3. add NuGet packages to startup project
		- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
		- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
		- and to the data access project
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	4. Open package manager Console in VS
		-  (view -> other windows -> package manager console)
		-  (alternate 4/5. run in git bash)
			- `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "<your connection string>"`
			- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
           	- `--project <name of data project>`
	5. Run command
		- `Scaffold-DBContext "<your-connection-string>" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -Project <name-of-data-project>` (-Force if necessary)
	6. Delete the OnConfiguring override in the DbContext, to prevent
		- committing your connection string to git.- 
	7. any time we change the DB (add a new col etc...), go to step 4
		- by default the scaffolding will configure the models in OnModelCreating
-  with the fluent API, this is the right way to do it - strongest separation of concerns
- if we scaffold with option "-DataAnnotations" (/"--data-annotations") we'll put the configs on the Movie
	- and Genre classes themselves with attributes
- 3rd way to configure is convention based
- Async
	- where any returns concrete values, we would apply async at end of those
		- start from bottom to top
	- read -> EF provides async extensions to LINQ
		- e.g. toList() would have async version and many others
	- write -> SaveChangesAsync


## Project 0
- wants interfaces for the repositories
	- can have one repository for everything
	- or split into multiple classes
		- e.g. OrderRepo, LocationRepo

## SQL DDL
```sql
-- DDL

-- DATA Definition Language
-- Operates on whole tables at a time, can't see individual rows
-- also works with lots of other DB obj, like views, functions, procedures
-- tirggers, constraints, etc...

-- to create, change, and delete these DB objs, we have
-- CREATE, ALTER, DROP

-- GO is a special keyword to separate batches of commands
-- some commands demand to be in their own batch
CREATE SCHEMA Movie;
GO

-- CREATE TABLE
-- create table gets comma-separated list of col
-- each col has name and data type
CREATE TABLE Movie.Movie(
	MovieId INT
);

SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie;

-- We have ALTER TABLE to add or delete col
--		(And do some other things too)
ALTER TABLE Movie.Movie ADD
	Title NVARCHAR(200);

-- delete an entire table
DROP TABLE Movie.Movie;

-- we can specify constraints on each col

-- constraints:
--	- NOT NULL (null not allowed)
--	- NULL (not really a constraint, just being explicit)
--		(the default behavior: null is allowed)
--	- PRIMARY KEY 
--		(sets PK, enforces uniqueness, sets clustered index)
--		(implies NOT NULL, but we like to be explicit anyways)
--	- UNIQUE (can be set on multiple col, take together)
--	- CHECK (arbitrary condition that must be true for each row)
--	- DEFAULT (give a default value for that col when inserted w/o an explicit value)
--		NULL is the default DEFAULT
--	- FOREIGN KEY
--	- IDENTITY(start, increment) (not exactly a constraint but similar)
--		IDENTITY(10, 10) would count 10, 20, 30, 40 etc
--		Default values are 1, 1. (Counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- by default we aren't allowed to give explicit values for IDENTITY col
--		you'd need to turn on IDENTITY_INSERT option
CREATE TABLE Movie.Movie (
	MovieId INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),
	Title NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
	ReleaseDate DATETIME2 NOT NULL,
	DateModified DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT(GETDATE()),
	CONSTRAINT U_Movie_Title_Date UNIQUE (Title, ReleaseDate),
	-- constraint PK_blah PRIMARY KEY (col1, col2) -- (composite PK)
	CONSTRAINT CHK_DateNotTooEarly CHECK (ReleaseDate > '1900')
);

INSERT INTO Movie.Movie (Title, ReleaseDate) VALUES (
	'LOTR: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING', '2001'
);

SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie;

DROP TABLE Movie.Genre;
CREATE TABLE Movie.Genre (
	GenreId INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
	Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	DateModified DATETIME2 DEFAULT(GETDATE()),
	CHECK (Name != ''),
);

ALTER TABLE Movie.Movie ADD
	GenreID INT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT FK_Movie_Genre FOREIGN KEY (GenreID) REFERENCES Movie.Genre(GenreId)

-- adding col without some default (or allowing null as default) is not allowed
-- workaround: allow NULL at first, fiz up existing rows, then add NOT NULL constraint

INSERT INTO Movie.Genre (NAME) VALUES ('Action/Adventure');

UPDATE Movie.Movie SET GenreID = 1;

SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie;

DELETE FROM Movie.Genre;

ALTER TABLE Movie.Movie 
	ALTER COLUMN  GenreID INT NOT NULL;


-- Computed columns

-- dropping FullName after making a mistake
--ALTER TABLE Movie.Movie DROP COLUMN FullName;

ALTER TABLE Movie.Movie ADD
	FullName AS (Title + ' (' + CONVERT(NVARCHAR, YEAR(ReleaseDate)) + ')');

SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie
-- Comuted col have different options like PERSISTED

-- view
GO

--ALTER VIEW Movie.NewReleases AS
--	SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie
--	WHERE RleaseDate 

CREATE VIEW Movie.NewReleases AS 
	SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie
	WHERE ReleaseDate > '2019-01-01';
GO

SELECT * FROM Movie.NewReleases;

INSERT INTO Movie.NewReleases (Title, ReleaseDate, GenreID) VALUES
	('LOTR: The Two Towers', '2019-02-01', 
		(SELECT GenreId FROM Movie.Genre WHERE Name = 'Action/Adventure'));

-- views provides an abstraction over the actual table structure
-- by running a query behind the scenes to generated what pretends to be a table

-- we can do inserts/updates/deletes through it too, but
-- only on col that directly map to real table col

--var in SQL server using @ symbols
DECLARE @action AS INT;
SET @action = 1;

-- table-valued var
DECLARE @my_table AS TABLE (
	col1 INT, col2 INT
);

-- can use above as a temporary table
-- use things like INSERT INTO @my_table
-- .. etc

-- user-defined functions
GO
CREATE FUNCTION Movie.MoviesReleasedInYear(@year INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
	DECLARE @result INT;

	SELECT @result = COUNT(*)
	FROM Movie.Movie
	WHERE YEAR(ReleaseDate) = @year;

	RETURN @result;
END
GO

SELECT Movie.MoviesReleasedInYear(2002);

-- functions do not allow writing any data = only reading

-- EXERCISE
-- 1. write a function to get the initials of a customer based on his ID (look up string functions)
GO
--CREATE FUNCTION CustomerInitials(@initials VARCHAR)
--RETURNS VARCHAR
--AS
--BEGIN
--	DECLARE @result VARCHAR;
--	SELECT @result = LEFT(c.FirstName, 1) + LEFT(c.LastName, 1)
--	FROM Customer AS c
--	RETURN @result;
--END

CREATE FUNCTION GetCustomerInitials(@Id INT)
RETURNS NVARCHAR(3)
AS
BEGIN
	DECLARE @initials NVARCHAR(3);

	-- in SQL, string indexing is 1-based
	SELECT @initials = SUBSTRING(FirstName, 1, 1) + SUBSTRING(LastName, 1, 1)
	FROM Customer
	WHERE CustomerId = @id;

	RETURN @initials;
END
GO

CREATE TRIGGER Movie.MovieDateModified ON Movie.Movie
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
	-- inside a trigger you have access to two special table vars
	-- inserted and deleted
	UPDATE Movie.Movie
	SET DateModified = GETDATE()
	WHERE MovieId IN (SELECT MovieId FROM inserted)
	-- in this case , inserted has the new verson of updated rows
END

SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie;
UPDATE Movie.Movie
SET Title = 'LOTR: FEllowship of the ring'
WHERE MovieId = 1;

-- we can do triggers on INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
-- they can be BEFORE, AFTER, or INSTEAD OF


-- PROCEDURES
-- procedure are like functions
-- but they allow any sql command inside them, including DB write
-- they don't have to return anything
-- you can only call them with EXECUTE, never inside a SELECT or anything else
GO
CREATE PROCEDURE Movie.RenameMovies(@newname NVARCHAR(50), @rowsChanged INT OUTPUT)
AS
BEGIN
	-- we can use WHILE loops, IF ELSE, TRY CATCH
	BEGIN TRY
		If (EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Movie.Movie))
		BEGIN 
			SET @rowsChanged = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Movie.Movie)
			UPDATE Movie.Movie
			SET Title = @newname
		END
		ELSE
		BEGIN
			SET @rowsChanged = 0;
			RAISERROR('No movies found!', 16, 1);
		END
		END TRY
	BEGIN CATCH
		PRINT ERROR_MESSAGE()
	END CATCH
END
GO

-- how to use a procedure, ALMOST correct
DECLARE @rowschanged INT;
EXECUTE Movie.RenameMovies 'Movie', @rowschanged;
SELECT @rowschanged;
