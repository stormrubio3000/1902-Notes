## angular things
- [npm (module)] --npm i-> /node_modules -- imports -> [component (module)] -exports-> [modules]
- [modules] -imports-> [component]
- [services (D)] -provides-> [Component (D) contains templateUrl, styleUrls, selector]
	- services D provided in root(singleton)
- a component represents a view
- services provides logic that many components can use
- `{{ name }}` is interpolation: in component.ts `this.name`
- `[disabled]="diabled"` is property binding: `this.disabled`
- `...(click)="handleClick(event)"`? : `handleClick(){....}`
- `[(ngModel)]="data"` is two way binding: `this.data`
	- need to import FormsModule 
- "semver": semantic versioning
	- major minor patch
		- major: when we break any backwards compatibility
	- minor: new features
	- patch: bugfix
	- e.g. `"^1.2.3"`: means min 1.2.3 and maximum 1.999.999
	- `"~1.23"`: 
		- means when a new feature comes out we check to see if it's good then manually update it
	- `"1.2.3"`: exact
- **CORS** stands for cross origin requests sharing
	- same-origin policy
		- server will only accept requests from browsers if they came from same url
		- In our case, Angular will be located in a different place so 
			- get `No Access-Control-Allow-Origin` error
	- API must be configured to allow some cross origin requests
- `npm run lint` looks for inconsistency within the code
	- checks to see if your code is good code (opinionated)
- testing with jasmine
	- `run ng test`
	- might need to `npm i --save-dev something`
		- save-dev is generally for testing
- `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage`
	- shows how many pieces of code that has been tested (statements, branches, functions, lines)
	- after running the command, then a coverage folder appears that you can grab the html file
		- view and can also view each file for what has been tested and not
- after `npm build`
	- we can run our build with `npx http-server dist/our-app`
	- he added in a `npm build-ci` in package
- now to have in our pipelines
	- we make a yml file
	- new build pipeline on azure dev
		- look for project repo
		- configure: choose existing azure pipelines
		- then you run

```yml
pool: 'Default'
variables: 
	appDir: 06-angular/pokemon-app

trigger:
	branches:
		include:
		- master
	paths:
		include:
		- 06-angular/pokemon-app

pool: 'Default'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
	inputs:
		versionSpec: '10.x'
	displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script:
		# install angular cli globally on the agent
		# npm install -g @angular/cli
		npm ci
		# build in production config, which activates
		# certain rules in angular.json (e.g. replace environment.ts
		# with environment.prod.ts)
		npm run build-ci --prod
	workingDirectory: ${appDir}
	displayName: 'npm install and build'

-task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
	displayName: Azure App Service deploy
	inputs: 
		azureSubscription: ....
		webAppName: ...

```

## Project stuffs to do
- inside environment you can define your production and development urls
- we can use `options.AddPolicy("AllowAll",`
	- can also use `.AllowAnyOrigin().AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod()`
		- made a model for Account to store account info
		- made login component
		- `.AllowCredentials()`
		- in login use `withCredentials: true` when returning
		- not recommended, should fill in our own headers and methods in real development
		- `ng g guard auth` to guard our routes 
			- choose `can activate()`
