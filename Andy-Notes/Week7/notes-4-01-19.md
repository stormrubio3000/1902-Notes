- April fools!

## Project 2 presentations

## Portfolio
- look at sample documents provided from Nick's training code
	- https://github.com/1902-feb18-net/training-code
- Nick wants everything except: 
	- industry equivalency
	- skill matrix
	- one third of About Me bullet points (just need 8/12 for now)

## Project 1 Summary
The clothing store web application is made for customers to be able to pick a store and make clothing purchases. After a user registers themselves, they are able to pick from a variety of types of fabric for their piece of clothing and add into a shopping cart. The business logic would allow users to make purchases of only existing products from an inventory and there are validations in place to make sure user submits the right information. Users are able to view their past purchases and total amount spent at their time of purchase.

## Angular Review
- Angular is a framework for building SPA with TS.
	- uses TS to achieve SPA
		- SPA where we have a complicated app managed by JS and dynamically changes the DOM
- we will have binding that connects data from our views and components
- Angular decorators 
	- provide some kind of metadata about some object
	- @ component @ ngModel @ injectable @ directive
		- @component -> manage a view: nest them
			- component class references a template (HTML + directive + binding) 
		- @module -> provides namespace and compilation context for components, other directives, pipes, services, etc...
		- @injectable makes things into services
			- view-independent logic that supports D.I. 
		- custom directives
			- directive is anything that are anything not HTML that goes in HTML
				- `ngStyle, ngClass` attribute
				- `*ngIf, *ngFor` structural
				- `app-pokemon, app-root` components
				- `router-outlet` other directives
- TS module vs NG module
	- TS
		- a .ts file with imports of the top and/or exports
		- this hold the file content out of JS global scope
	- NG
		- to class with a @NgModule decorator -> something
		- know about ng stuffs
		- need min of one module which becomes root module (AppModule)
- we have a lot of typescript 
	- interfaces
	- classes
	- uses decorators to make these special objects
- Try going to the "Fundamentals" angular.io guide
- Hero Tutorial

## Angular Review
- **Angular** platform and framework for building client apps in HTMl and TypeScript
	- implements core and optional functionality as a set of TS lib that you can import into your apps
- **NgModules**
	- basic building blocks that provides compilation context for components
	- collects related code into functional sets 
		- set of NgModules = Angular app
- **root module**
	- every app has at least one of these that enables bootstrapping and more feature modules
- **components** 
	- defines *views*
		- sets of screen elements that ng can choose among and modify according to program's logic and data
	- define *services*
		- provides specific functionalities not directly related to views. 
		- can be injected into components as dependencies
			- code more modular, reusable, efficient
- components and services are simply classes with **decorators**
	- marks their type and provide metadata that tells ng how to use them
	- metadata for component class associates with a *template*
		- defines a view
		- HTML + ng directives + binding markup allows ng to modify HTML before rendering for display
		- metadata for service class provides info ng needs to make available to components through DI
- app's components defines many views and Router service provides navigational capabilities
- **NgModules** 
	- declares compilation context for set of components dedicated to an app's domain, a workflow or related set of capabilities
	- associates components with related code such as services to form functional units
- **AppModule** or **root module** provides bootstrap mechanism that launches the application
	- app contains many functional modules
	- can import functionality from other NgModules and allow its own functionality to be exported and used by other NgModules
- **Components** 
	- ng app has at least one component, *root component* which connects a component hierarchy with the page DOM.
	- defines a class that contains app data and logi and associated with an HTMl template defining a view to be displayed in target env
	- @Component() decorator identifies the class blow it as a component, and provides the template and related component specific metdata
	- **decorators** are functions that modify JS classes
		- ng defines a number of decorators that attach different kinds of metadata to classes so system knows what those classes mean and how they should work
- **template**
	- combines HTMl with Angular markup that can modify HTML elements before displayed
	- **template directive** provides program logic
	- **binding markup** connects you app data and the DOM
	- 2 types of data binding
		- **event binding** app responds to user input in the target env by updating app data
		- **property binding** lets you incorporate values that are computed from your app data into HTMl
	- before view is displayed, ng eval directives and resolved the binding syntax in template to modify HTML elements and the dom
	- supports 2 way data binding so changes in DOM (e.g. user inputs) are reflected in program data
	- can use **pipes** to improve user exp by transforming values for display. 
- Services and dependency injection
	- created when you want data/logic not associated with specific view and to share across components
	- A service class definition preceded by **@Injectable()** decorator
		- provides metadata that allows other providers to be injected as dependencies into your class
		- **dependency injection** keeps your component classes lean and efficient by delegating such tasks(fetch data from server, validate user input, or log to console) to services
- Routing
	- NgModule provides a service that lets you define navigation path among diff app states and view hierarchies in your app
		- enter url in address bar, click links on page, and browser's back and forward buttons

- modules
	- **NgModules** are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. 
		- They can contain components, service providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule. 
		- They can import functionality that is exported from other NgModules, and export selected functionality for use by other NgModules.
		- Every Angular app has at least one NgModule class, the **root module**, which is conventionally named **AppModule** and resides in a file named app.module.ts. 
			- You launch your app by bootstrapping the root NgModule.
- **@NgModules**:
	- declarations: The components, directives, and pipes that belong to this NgModule.
	- exports: The subset of declarations that should be visible and usable in the component templates of other NgModules.
	- imports: Other modules whose exported classes are needed by component templates declared in this NgModule.
	- providers: Creators of services that this NgModule contributes to the global collection of services; they become accessible in all parts of the app. (You can also specify providers at the component level, which is often preferred.)
	- bootstrap: The main application view, called the root component, which hosts all other app views. Only the root NgModule should set the bootstrap property.
