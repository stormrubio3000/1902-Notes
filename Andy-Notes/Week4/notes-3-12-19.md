## SDLC
- Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
	- waterfall model
		- gather requirements
		- design architecture of the application
		- build the application
		- test that the code work (more than xUnit, bring in human testers)
		- deploy the application (deliver to client or host on internet)
	- could throw 6+ months in this process, hard to implement this model
	- have to follow the sequence and can't go back
	- disadvantages: slow, not adaptable
	- pros: enables more security, more accountability
- Iterative models
	- spiral model
		- mini waterfalls: finish mini waterfall get client's feedback, then redo it with new additions
			- pros: responsive to client's feedback
	- big bang model
		- do everything all at once before the project is due 
		- pros: suitable for prototypes 
			- explore technologies to see if it meets your needs
	- **Agile**: a methodology 
		- Break projects up into features/small features called *user stories*
			- run individual user stories through stages of our development
		- **SCRUM**
			- user stories: involves a bunch of layers, but on one specific task
				- feature/bugfix
			- scrum board
				- possible board format: backlog, in progress, testing, done, released
				- person responsible for task, and due dates
			- Scrum Master
				- lead the daily stand up
				- ensure the scrum process is followed by the team
				- lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments (blocking issues) that arise during the sprint.
			- Sprint: 2-6 weeks on user stories
				- sprint planning: formalize user stories
				- daily standup: quick summary how each members are doing
					- what did you do for the last day
					- what are you doing for today/next day
					- identify blockers (what's preventing you from completing)
				- sprint extrospective/review
					- talk about how well we did during sprint and what we can improve for next one
					- capacity: product work hours/points available in sprint
					- velocity: each user stories has estimated "effort" in points
						- use fibonaci to estimate effort (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) round to nearest
						- sum of effort points completed during the sprint
			- backlog: all stories uncompleted in project
				- We can pick from this to add into a sprint
			- Stakeholder: anyone with a stake on project
				- should communicate with client often and possibly redesign if needed
			- Strict schedule for completing present amount of work with re evaluation after each sprint
		- Kanban
			- no sprints
			- continuous planning, continuous reflection/reevaluation
			- "kanban board"
			- each col in board has a maximum # of pts it can contain
			- attempts to limit max work in progress and with continuous reevaluation
		- CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration ) 
			- very process heavy version of Agile
				- security
				- accountability 
		- way for users to submit feedback and plug that into project board	


## [DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-devops)
	- How to achieve
		- Continuous Integration
		- Continuous Delivery
		- Version Control
		- Agile Planning and lean Project Management
		- Monitoring and Logging
		- public and hybrid Clouds
		- Infrastructure as Code
		- Microservices
		- Containers
## [Continuous Integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/azure/devops/cicd?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
## Azure services
## [Agile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
## [Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)

## Windows Settings
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/?view=aspnetcore-2.2

## iis-configuration
- search for apps and features -> Turn windows features on and off
	- check Internet Information Services
- now you open up your project and right click on webapp project and 'Publish'
	- go IIS tab
	- fill out `localhost` and `default web site/someName`
	- Next -> Release, netcoreapp2.2, framework-dependent
		- file publish options, check remove additional files
- MUST RUN AS ADMINISTER IN VS 
- ditched, didnt work

## azure way
- make it
	- app services -> create 
- now back to publish in VS project
	- pick first option and pick your online azure app thing
- more problems, needs access to connection string
	- go to resource and find published app
	- now go to connections(preview) and add in your user secrets stuffs

## Azure DevOps
- Visual studio Online -> Visual Studios Team Services -> Visual Studios Dev Ops
- configuration as code
	- computer and human readable
	- YAML pipelines, code form of the previous thing, shipped feature before done (learning curve)
- automated pipeline for our initial version 
	- fetch latest code from github
	- build code
	- run tests
	- deploy to azure app service
- azure dev ops contains a handful of service
	- azure pipeline
	- azure boards
	- gitub call repos
	- artifact (have your own nuget just for our private use)
- bunch of things, and set up yaml pipeline now
	- yada yada, use the sample yml, add in your info
	- something
	- now let's edit yaml some more, and let's publish
		- `dotnet publish ClothingStore/ClothingStore.WebApp/ --configuration Release --output ./publish
`
