## CSS
- Display property:
	- inline
		- all buddy buddy next to each other
		- e.g. `li {display: inline}`
	- block
		- hogs up a line/space for itself
	- inline-block
		- a mix of both
	- none
		- invisible, no place in document
	- visibility: hidden
		- just invisible but still exists there
- Position property:
	- static (default)
	- relative
		- left, right, top, bottom
		- able to shift to wherever you want, woohooo
	- absolute
		- also uses left, right, top, bottom
		- offsetting relative to the parent container
		- will take up entire width of parent (need set up own width and height)
	- fixed
		- left, right, top, bottom
		- fixes the element to the overall viewport
		- pastes element to window pane (think of those annoying ads)
- Layout Tools
	- Flexbox
	- Grid Layout
		- helpful making some 2d grid of something
	- Column layout
- Properties
	- color:
		- foreground and background
	- font-family
		- sets type of font (e.g. times new roman etc...)
	- font-weight
		- bold face
	- font-style
		- italics and other
- **Inheritance**
	- inherited
		- by color
		- font-family
	- not
		- border
		- padding
		- margin
- CSS resets
	- reset all of the user agent styles and bring back to 0
	- because inconsistent across all browsers
	- more control for us, yay!
	- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
		- sets to some standard default that they determine is sensible
- media queries: allows us to have additional rules for the browser
	- screen aspect-ratio
	- height and width
	- provides different setup for touchscreen/mouse 
	- "print preview" reformats page to be suitable for printing
- adaptive design
	- write many css files that works for all kinds of devices
	- 1 per resolution
- responsive design
	- things scales nicely
	- 1 Css file and the page will automatically reformat w/o a refresh
	- we use CSS Libraries to help us with this
		- e.g. bootstrap, Zurb Foundation
- Bootstrap is based on a 12 column grid
	- nicely divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6
	- step size on arranging our elements based on the grid
	- apply classes by looking at BS documentation

## ASP.NET and CSS
- IIS (internet information service) Express is a lightweight, self-contained version of IIS optimized for developers. IIS Express makes it easy to use the most current version of IIS to develop and test websites.
	- Client (browser) -sends request-> Server (IIS Express) 
		- on server, .html, css, js living on disk and sent back with response
- ASP
	- active server pages, aka "web forms"
	- .aspx files have special syntax to connect to .NET code behind it
		- syntax inside HTML
		- poor separation of concerns (hard to reuse and test)
	- ASP.NET MVC is framework for building web applications
		- in .NET with strong separation of concerns using the MVC design
	- **MVC** is a design pattern
		- models
			- object oriented data sent to or received from client
		- views 
			- the templates for the HTML
			- display logic
			- all about layout and appearance
				- can include css, js
			- give views their models and render them into html (WOOO! awesome gnarley)
		- controllers
			- object(s) that receive requests from clients 
			- marshall the models and views together to construct the response
		- Views -> Models
		- Model <- Controller -> View
			- model is a boss, depends on itself
- localhost is when the computer is hosting itself (local server)
