# Revature Notes 2/22/19

## SOLID Principles
- *single-responsibility principle*
	- a class/method should just do one thing
- *Open Closed Principle*
	- entities should be open for **extension**, closed for modification
	- we like to see new behaviors that won't interfere with the old behaviors
	- try not to modify existing methods
- *Liskov Substitution Principle*
	- Objects should be replacable by instances of their subtypes
		- without altering the correctness of the code
		- e.g. `XmlSerializer : Serializer`
- *Interface Segregation Principle*
	- Many interfaces should be split up into many light interfaces
	- more free to extend stuffs later, instead of all or nothing with a heavy interface
- *Dependency Inversion Principle*
	- Instead of high level code depending on low level code or vice versa
		- both should depend on interfaces
		- When a class knows explicitly about the design and implementation of another class, it raises the risk that changes to one class will break the other class

## Other
- **is**: instead of `== null` we can use `is null`
	- similar to Python
- GAC: global assembly cache
	- C:\Windows\assembly
	- to achieve it, we created "strongly name" so that they must have version numbers
- NuGet:
	- package manager, replaces idea of global installation (e.g. GAC)
	- more local and not interfering, can get new version if we ask it to
	- easier to deploy apps to new systems
	- tied with `dotnet restore` or `nuget restore`
- errors: (from most serious to least)
	- most serious is fatal, aka critical
	- Warn/Warning
	- info
	- debug
	- trace
- Separation of Concerns
	- we minimize what we call tight coupling
	- being directly dependent on another class
	- wants to be a loose couple LOL
- Comment your code
	- use XML comments for the public API
	- inline comments to explain why we did something
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself
	- put into separate methods or classes if you find yourself repeating
- KISS: keep it simple stupid
	- making code that other coders can understand

## **REGULAR EXPRESSION**
- [Rubular](https://rubular.com/) used to test regular expressions
- e.g. "2019-02-22 10:30:54.0847 DEBUG logger created successfully"
	- with `[\d-]+ [\d:.]+ (\w+)`
	- we can grab the `DEBUG`

## Project 0:
- due Wednesday week 3
- try to get 
	1. Library + Tests
	2. Console
- console app to manage a store and inventory
	- Let's assume we have a clothing store
		- complexity will be the types of fabric, size, color probably
- keep track of customers
	- Database stuff we can't access yet
- store/locations
	- ClothingStore.Library Models for Locations
	- this is for customer
- orders/orderhistory
	- ClothingStore.Library Models for Orders
- statistics on orders (volume of sales and etc use LINQ)
	- make sure to use LINQ for statistics
		- maybe use this extension method called [Linq Statistics](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqStatistics/)
		- add in sum of your orders
		- show average of your orders
		- then some others whenever I think of them
- inventory:
	- inventory will include things like shirts, pants, jackets
- complexity to things you can buy
	- probably what type of shirt: long sleeves, short sleeves, collared, color, size etc...
	- pants will be shorts, long, fit, waist size, etc...
	- by default must have size, color, and price
- need some business rules
	- credit card: cannot use if under 20$
	- can't buy more than x number of some special product
	- not sure if I want to add special sales of buy 2, get 1 50% or something
- menu based interface
	- add your location
	- browse locations
		- if exists, we now have options such as:
			- browse by clothing categories
				- browse by item types (e.g. red, short sleeved, sized M, collared shirt)
			- option to add to your shopping cart
			- Edit your shopping cart
- 3 projects: Library, Console, Tests for library
	- Console will be what the program will use to run everything
		- this will be where user will type in their input and magic happens
	- Library will be split into two things
		- Models:
			- Store
				- name, inventory, collection of orders, some statistics on things sold
			- Order
				- list of things bought, total sum of purchase, num of items bought, restaurant location
		- Repository: will manage data access
			- Store
			- Order
- want to save/load from file
- wants us to use Logging of some form
	- let's use [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Tutorial) for our logging
