Everytime you make a request looks at cookies. and sends all that are under that domain and not expired.




for the cookie thing was downloading Identity.EF

Look at his CharacterRestServices for setting up the cookies auth and all that. Its a whole mess but its a thing
Will be much better to just look at it done then trying to keep up with the steps.

Everything he has done so far has been in the startup.cs
[Authorize]  in controller over an action method means any logged in can do it.
or you can just throw it at the top of the whole controller

so for the role for users thing has to do with something called claims we just decide if we believe them or not

Role based operation is easier tho. Took a nap.... probs wasn't the best idea.


							JavaScript
console.log(''); is the write line for js.
assigning a variable is let x = 0

all numbers are just a number all wrapped up.

object has reference semantics. 

debugger is a breakpoint


'use strict'; at the top. opting in to the 'new way' of things that fixes things and is better.


2 scopes. Global and function
