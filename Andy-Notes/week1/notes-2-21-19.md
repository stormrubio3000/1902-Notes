# Revature notes: 2/21/19

## NOTE TO SELF
- grab mac preferences for sublime
- try find a way to avoid space completion...
- look at Nick's MemoryList implementation
- go over some codeSignal using Links

## LINQ
- [LINQ reference docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netstandard-2.0)

## .NET
- is a platform for many languages
	- C# being the most popular
	- F#
	- VB.NET
	- Python
	- Java
	- R
	- Typescript/JS
- interoperability between languages
	- provides a lot of similar infrastructure to tie in other languages to work with one another
- defines a interfaces for anyone to make a .NET runtime
- **.NET Common language infrastructure (CLI)**
	- an interface standard for what a runtime has to have to be good
	- **virtual execution system (VES)**
	- **Common Type System (CTS)**
		- arrays belongs here
	- **Base Class Library (BCL)**
		- Lists and stuffs
- .NET Command-Line Interface (CLI) 
	- "dotnet" command that we use
- First step to build (1. .NET code in .cs file) -> (2. C# compiler using dotnet build,msbuild, csc ) -> (3. **intermediate language(IL)**)
	- 3 is called IL, CIL (common IL), MSIL (microsoft IL), bytecode, assembly
		- (.dll, .exe)
	- is an instruction set for the VES
		- VES is equivalent to Java JVM
- Second Step to run: Inside VES[(JIT compiler) -> (Native Instructions) -> (CPU runs)]
	- Just in time (JIT) compiler
- implementations...
	- .NET Framework (MS) v4.7~
		- Windows only 
		- msbuild back then instead of dotnet
	- .NET Core (MS) v2.2~
		- cross platform: write once, run anywhere
	- Mono 
		- is a port of framework for Mac/Linux
		- obsolete
- ADO.NET 
	- (data sccess technology provide communication between relational and non relational systems)
	- access data and data services from a database
- ASP.NET (web based dev)
- WPF (windows style popups and form control, tied to Windows)
- WCF (web services)
- interoperability
- cross platform
	- platform independent
- architecture independent
- exception handling
	- types
	- managed environment (GC garbage collection)
- .NET Standard: common def for what both .NET Framework and core should do
	- common subset .NET Framework and .NET agrees with
- **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is VES implementation

## Links:
- something something practice later

## Delegates:
- filler text

## OOP principles (WHAT IS IT? GIVE AN EXAMPLE)
- abstraction
	- detail hiding
	- separation between needed functionality and and implementation details
	- e.g. properties, methods, CTS, List
- encapsulation
	- data hiding
	- one way to achieve abstraction
	- restricting access to information within obj,
		- packaging related things together, and treating them as a unit
	- e.g. object, access modifiers
- polymorphism
	- possibility of many implementations behind a common contract
	- method overriding
	- method overloading: same name, but can take in different params
	- ability to treat a derived-class obj as though it were a base class obj
- inheritance (IS-A)
	- ability for a class to take and extend behavior and state from another class
	- e.g. MemoryList do all what a list does + more
- **Composition** (HAS-A)
	- fields and properties
	- contain an object instance of another class

## Serialization and Asynchronous programming
- filler text

## PROJECT 0
- console app to manage a store and inventory
- keep track of customers
- store/locations
- orders/orderhistory
- statistics on orders (volume of sales and etc use LINQ)
- inventory blah blah
- complexity to things you can buy
	- e.g. order pizza -> inventory: dough, cheese
- need some business rules
	- e.g. no more than 10 pizzas per order allowed
- menu based interface
- 3 projects: Library, Console, Tests for library
- want to save/load from file
- wants us to use Logging of some form
